[00:00:06] Doug McIntyre: Let me, disclose the fact that I&#8217;ve known Catherine Wood, the founder, therefore. At least 40 years. I work with her foundation, but leaving that stuff aside, this is something that&#8217;s taken a real beating over the last couple years and it is now trading at 71, which is basically, if it&#8217;s 52 week high and that&#8217;s up from 30 a low of 36. [00:00:33] Lee Jackson: Oh, it, early on in the COVID thing it just exploded higher, and went, I&#8217;m like. It was going up every single day for about a year. And, then the typical thing happened, we got the sell off in 22 or whatever it was, and, it was hard on her. But, she&#8217;s a lot bolder than most PMs, and she was owning a lot of these names before 2025. [00:01:02] Lee Jackson: So, and it wasn&#8217;t, Fred Laffer, her college instructor at USC, the Reagan guy. The Reagan econ guy. Yeah. [00:01:09] Doug McIntyre: she still talks about Yeah. Theory and believes in it. But if you look at some of the stuff they own, they own Robinhood. I know they own, yeah. [00:01:21] Doug McIntyre: But they own stuff like Robinhood. Coinbase. These are things that were, when they started in their early years, they were long shots. Those, there&#8217;s. No reason to believe that those were gonna automatically be around. Oh, absolutely. I mean, the way she made this work was to get into stuff early that people were skeptical about it. [00:01:40] Doug McIntyre: ARKK sold off a lot because people were skeptical about those businesses losing money going back a year or two. And now they&#8217;re rebound. Is that these, most of these companies are starting to be successful? [00:01:54] Lee Jackson: Yeah. she was an early, Nvidia investor. think she was pretty early on Broadcom (NASDAQ: AVGO). [00:02:01] Lee Jackson: I mean, she took some real bold technology shots that some people weren&#8217;t taking at all. And, it, it was huge at first and then just a massive sell off. But again, like any other good manager, if you believe in everything, then you certainly believe it at a 52 week low. [00:02:20] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. and listen, I think that the thing that&#8217;s sort of impressive is that she didn&#8217;t take big parts of the portfolio and just say, well, you know something, we&#8217;re gonna just sell these off and we&#8217;re, gonna take our stuff and we&#8217;re just gonna rotate it into something else. [00:02:34] Lee Jackson: Right? [00:02:35] Doug McIntyre: we&#8217;re gonna stick with what we always thought was best. And we&#8217;re not gonna say, well, we don&#8217;t really like this anymore. we&#8217;re gonna bail out and go find a bunch of other stuff we want out. [00:02:47] Lee Jackson: No, and I think that&#8217;s why, investors that have been with her a long time and they&#8217;ve made a lot of money, I think that&#8217;s why many of, the early investors probably stuck around. [00:02:59] Lee Jackson: &#8217;cause they were like, look there, she&#8217;s not selling off positions and we believe in this. So, she&#8217;ll move off a bad name if she needs to, but every PM will do that. She was a really unique breath of fresh air, five, six years ago whenever it started to really catch fire. [00:03:15] Doug McIntyre: Yeah. and they were early into things like Palantir. [00:03:18] Lee Jackson: Yeah. [00:03:19] Doug McIntyre: Oh, very early. Which is not as still considered sort of a risky stock because of its relationship, the amount of its revenue from government, US government. But anyway, as I said, I know her. I need to disclose that I know her, but I think there&#8217;s a lot of objective reasons that knowing her doesn&#8217;t have anything to do with, to say this has come back and it&#8217;s come back because the company she believed in came back. [00:03:45] Lee Jackson: Right. And for the younger investor, if you&#8217;re a Gen Z investor or, even one of the young millennials, this is a good thing to have in your portfolio. An idea. Overweight it, well, maybe not, but it&#8217;s not a bad thing to have 10, 15% of in there for just sheer unadulterated growth, and future growth. [00:04:06] Doug McIntyre: Probably not a great investment if you&#8217;re 80, but it&#8217;s certainly if you&#8217;re no, if you&#8217;re sort of pre 50, it&#8217;s probably a good investment. So yeah, again, the disclosure. I know Catherine would&#8217;ve known her for a long, long time, but, I can still admire her whether I&#8217;ve known her for a long time. Sure, [00:04:22] Lee Jackson: you can.

Coinbase Deal 10:12 am by Gerelyn Terzo Digital asset exchange Coinbase (Nasdaq: COIN) has partnered with AI giant Perplexity AI in a deal that is reportedly designed to &#8220;to help traders get access to real-time trusted crypto data/info for better decision making.&#8221; Coinbase stock is trading lower by 0.60%. Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) will hold its annual shareholder meeting in early November. TSLA stock is gaining 2.4% but remains down 24.8% year-to-date. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets are meandering in and out of positive territory after the Nasdaq Composite clinched a fresh all-time high in yesterday&#8217;s session. As of early morning trading, the three major stock market indices are relatively flat. The Trump administration isn&#8217;t done slapping tariffs on trade partners, the most recent of which involves a 50% tariff on Brazilian imports. On the economic front, U.S. jobless claims moved lower last week, surprising economists amid mixed signals from the labor market. HSBC analysts have their eye on Advanced Micro Devices (Nasdaq: AMD), saying its recent AI chip solution has thrust it into the AI spotlight, potentially giving AI Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) a run for its money. HSBC has attached a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating on AMD shares with a bullish price target of $200 per share, reflecting upside potential of approximately 44%. Yesterday, Nvidia made history by becoming the first company to cross the $4 trillion market cap threshold. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 21.94 (+0.05%) Nasdaq Composite: Down 54.91 (-0.27%) S&amp;P 500: Down 5.52 (0.09%) Market Movers MP Materials (NYSE: MP) stock is soaring 55% after the company inked a rare Earth-mining contract with the Department of Defense to strengthen the U.S. magnet supply. The deal is reportedly worth billions of dollars, including a $400 million capital injection by the DoD for preferred shares and a warrant, making the government agency a major shareholder of MP Materials. The Trump administration previously tipped its hand to deals like this as the U.S. goes head-to-head with China. Delta Airlines (NYSE: DAL) stock is soaring 12% today on strong quarterly results amid &#8220;stabilizing&#8221; travel demand. The airline managed to beat expectations in H1 2025 and increase its quarterly dividend payout by 25%, beginning in September. WK Kellogg (NYSE: KLG) is skyrocketing by 30% today after agreeing to be taken over by Italy&#8217;s Ferrero, which is behind the popular Nutella product, in a blockbuster $3.1 billion merger.

As investors navigate the turbulent waters of tariff-driven volatility in 2025, dividend stocks have emerged as a safe harbor, delivering superior returns compared to the broader market. While the default strategy might be to anchor portfolios with blue-chip payers like Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), smart money might also look to small-cap stocks. These smaller companies, typically with market caps under $2 billion, often possess untapped potential and the capacity for substantial upside due to their lower starting valuations. Our research has uncovered three intriguing small-cap dividend stocks, all trading below $50 per share, that appear poised for potential future appreciation. It&#8217;s true that small-cap investments come with elevated risk, but the potential rewards can be equally substantial. While we lack a crystal ball, these selected companies have demonstrated promising performance and attractive dividend yields. We acknowledge that some of these selections may have grown slightly beyond the conventional $2 billion small-cap threshold; however, their continued presence in prominent small-cap ETFs confirms their relevance to this segment. Key Points Kodiak Gas Services (KGS): High 5.1% yield, strong EBITDA growth, and analyst upgrades support potential return to 52-week highs. Buckle (BKE): Zero debt, rising same-store sales, and 16% margins make it a resilient small-cap retail dividend pick. Farmers National (FMNB): 5.1% yield, strong Q1 earnings growth, and expanding deposits highlight this undervalued small-cap bank’s upside. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Kodiak Gas Services (NYSE: KGS) There are a couple of reasons to like Kodiak Gas Services (NYSE: KGS) stock. At $36 per share, Kodiak offers a high dividend yield of 5.1%. Given its market capitalization of $3.1 billion, Kodiak is in the gray area for small-cap stocks but is included in Fidelity&#8217;s Small Cap Dividend Growth Fund. In Q2 2025, Kodiak announced an increase to its quarterly cash dividend to $0.45 per share, up 10% compared with Q4 2024 levels. If you were to purchase 100 shares of KGS stock at current levels and hold it for 10 years with DRIP, based on the latest performance, you could expect a total return of 57.3% as well as annual dividend income of $256.19. Over the past 12 months, Kodiak stock is up approximately 38.4%, though it continues to trade below its 52-week high of $50 per share. In its most recent quarterly results, Kodiak lifted the range of its full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance in response to what management described as an &#8220;outstanding quarter.&#8221; With these positive catalysts, the stock could revisit recent highs sooner rather than later. Wall Street analysts are increasingly optimistic about Kodiak stock. Most recently, Stifel increased its price target on the stock by $1 to $46 per share with a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating attached. The analyst firm said that despite an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, Kodiak is full speed ahead in the Permian basin, where it compresses natural gas for pipeline transportation. Buckle (NYSE: BKE) With a dividend yield of 3.2%, specialty retailer Buckle (NYSE: BKE) makes a quarterly distribution of $0.35 per share. The stock currently trades for approximately $42 per share, in the midpoint of its 52-week range. Wall Street analysts mostly advise holding the stock, with an average price target of $40 per share. The markets may be underappreciating BKE stock considering the company&#8217;s strong balance sheet. Buckle carries zero long-term debt. By purchasing 100 shares of BKE at current levels, and holding for 10 years with DRIP, you could expect annual dividend income of just over $191 and more than just a preservation of capital. Buckle recently reported a 6.1% jump in its same-store sales for the four-week period leading up to early May and has also been experiencing an increase in online sales. The company&#8217;s net sales in the same period increased 7% to $85.5 million. This performance is a shift from a tough 2024 in which revenues were on a downward trajectory. For example, in the first three quarters of 2024, Buckle suffered a 5% decline in revenues. But 2025 is off to a good start. In Q1, Buckle reported net income of $35.2 million, or $0.70 per share. Buckle competes with the likes of Target and Amazon but still manages an attractive profit margin of nearly 16%. If Buckle can keep up this performance, it might have further upside potential and could be worth a spot in a dividend investor&#8217;s portfolio. Farmers National (Nasdaq: FMNB) Canfield, Ohio-based Farmers National (Nasdaq: FMNB) stock trades for just over $13 per share. The company has a dividend yield of 5.1%. In May 2025, Farmers National recently declared its latest quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share. Wall Street has an average price target of $15 on Farmers National stock, reflecting upside potential of approximately 13%. FMNB stock is held by big institutions including BlackRock, Vanguard LSV Asset Management. With a purchase of 100 shares at current levels, and holding for 10 years with DRIP, you could expect annual dividend income of just over $111 and a total return of roughly 66% over that period. In Q1 2025, Farmers National reported net income of $13.6 million compared with $11.2 million year-over-year. Farmers National CEO Kevin Helmick described the bank&#8217;s &#8220;position of strength,&#8221; pointing to a &#8220;legacy of profitability, strong asset quality and robust liquidity levels&#8221; despite economic uncertainty. Farmers has growing customer deposits and has been expanding its footprint into new markets, the most recent of which was Columbus, Ohio. Investors who might want exposure to financial services might want to consider Farmers National for its steady dividend and potential for capital appreciation.

Each of these stocks have the potential of an upside as the economy improves. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Ever since I started my investment journey, dividend stocks have remained a favorite, and for good reason. I enjoy the steady passive income and reinvest the dividends to keep the money growing. With hundreds of dividend-paying companies in the industry, it is possible to choose high-yield stocks that have a steady record of rewarding shareholders and an ability to sustain dividends, even in tough times. The stock market has shown volatility since the start of the year amid recession concerns and tariff uncertainty. I continue to choose stocks that provide safety and passive income. I’ve invested in these dividend stocks for 15 years and they have become a core part of my passive income plan. These companies can not only sustain the dividends but also increase them in the coming years. Here are my top picks. Johnson &amp; Johnson A dividend portfolio remains incomplete without Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). One of the top healthcare stocks, the company is an exceptional brand with a global presence and a unique product line. The company has a lineup of medicines across different areas including oncology, neuroscience, and immunology. It holds more than 10 drugs which generate about $1 billion in sales each year. In the first quarter, the company saw a 2.4% jump in sales to $21.9 billion and it has increased the full-year sales guidance. Its EPS stood at $4.54 and the majority of the sales were driven by the innovative medicine segment. Additionally, the company has an impressive pipeline of drugs which means the company will keep growing even if the revenue increases at a slower pace. It also has the pricing power to handle negotiations with the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The company has increased dividends for 63 consecutive years and currently has a yield of approximately 3.1%. Johnson &amp; Johnson has been around for over a century and it has seen it all. The healthcare leader is known as a Dividend King for a reason. 3M Another top pick, 3M (NYSE:MMM) is a highly diversified business and provides services in multiple industries. The company has four segments, namely, transportation, healthcare, safety, and industrial and consumer. The company achieved an organic sales growth of 1.5% and an EPS of $1.88, up 10% year over year in the first quarter. It reported slower growth but the management is expecting better earnings in the coming quarters. 3M is focusing on operational improvements to turn around the business. Trading for $149, the stock is up 15% year-to-date and 51% in 12 months. Despite the weak sales environment and ongoing market volatility, 3M hasn’t disappointed investors. CEO Bill Brown has laid out several initiatives to turn the business around. He is focusing on revitalizing new product introductions, which could improve sales growth and margins. MMM enjoys a dividend yield of 1.97% and has increased dividends for 65 years. While the short-term outlook may not look attractive, 3M is for long-term investors and its dividends are worth watching out for. There is no doubt that the industry is operating in an environment that is highly volatile right now. However, if the economic outlook improves through the de-escalation of the trade conflict, 3M has the potential to see higher sales and revenue. Coca Cola The top beverage giant is a favorite of Warren Buffett and he holds over 400 million shares in the company. Coke (NYSE: KO) is a highly diversified business with the most valuable brands including Sprite, Minute Maid, Fanta, and Diet Coke. In the first quarter, Coca-Cola reported sales of $11.22 billion and an EPS of 73 cents. Despite a 2% drop in net sales, the company saw a 6% rise in organic revenue. The management has maintained the full-year forecast and expects the tariff disruptions to be manageable. Despite the tariffs, it is a well-shielded company that will keep paying you each quarter. The company has raised dividends for over six decades and enjoys a yield of 2.84%. It announced a 5.2% year-over-year rise in the quarterly per-share payout and the company has the ability to afford to keep paying dividends. KO stock is exchanging hands for $71 and is up 16% year-to-date. This is a solid dividend stock to buy under $100. The name, reliability, and the global presence make Coca-Cola a top dividend king to own. I have held Coca-Cola for over 15 years and I am nowhere near giving up on it. Procter &amp; Gamble One of the largest consumer products companies, Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) has become a household name today. It is a leader in healthcare, beauty and grooming, and baby and family care. The company owns some of the biggest brands including Pampers, Gillette, Tide, Olay, and Pantene. Since it doesn’t rely on a particular country, brand, or category, it has a heavily diversified business that will keep generating revenue. It is in a better position to handle tariff-related issues and inflationary pressure. In the recently announced results, the company reported a 2% rise in net sales and a 3% jump in organic revenue. Its EPS came in at $1.88 and the management has reiterated the full-year outlook. Exchanging hands for $167, PG stock is flat year-to-date and up 2.8% in 12 months. The stock is far from cheap, it has a P/E ratio of 26.64, higher than its 10-year median of 25.7 but paying a premium for the stock might be worthwhile in an uncertain environment like today. The company has a dividend yield of 2.52% and it has increased dividends for 69 consecutive years. If you want to play super-safe, this is the Dividend king to own.

Make it make you money. It can make you a good deal of consistent money if you invest wisely in higher-yielding Dividend King stocks. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Put your money to work and make it make you money. Unfortunately, it’s not going to make you much money in a standard low-yielding savings account. But it can make you a good deal of consistent money if you invest wisely in higher-yielding Dividend King stocks. Not only are you investing in reliable growth, but you’re also investing in a company with reliable dividends. Look at Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), for example. The company just approved its 63rd consecutive annual dividend increase, raising its quarterly dividend to 51 cents per share. It’s considered a Dividend King because it’s been paying out a dividend for more than 50 years. In KO’s case, it’s been distributing yield since 1971. Today, if you bought $25,000 worth of the KO stock, you would take ownership of 349 shares. With a $2.04 annual payout, you can sit back and collect about $712 in yearly income. And all you had to do was buy and hold a popular stock. As for other Dividend Kings to consider, here are three you may want to buy today. Pepsico With a yield of 4.3%, Pepsico (NASDAQ: PEP) is a familiar name with a strong, dependable yield. PEP has now raised its dividend for the 53rd time since 1965. Most recently, PEP paid out a quarterly dividend of $1.4225 per share – a 5% increase year over year – on June 30. Annualized, that’s $5.69. So, if you invest $25,000 in PEP now, you can take ownership of about 188 shares. You’re buying a dependable company with years of success. And, using today’s PEP price of $132.60, you can collect $1,069.72 in yearly income just by holding the PEP stock. Helping, analysts at RBC just reiterated a sector perform rating on the stock with a target price of $163 per share. We also have to consider the company is investing in inorganic growth as it gets more involved with healthier food and beverages. For example, PEP just acquired Poppi – a healthy soda brand – for $1.95 billion. American States Water With a yield of 2.41%, Dividend King, American States Water (NYSE: AWR) provides water and electric services with a strong history of consistent dividend increases. It’s paid out a dividend every year since 1931. While it may sound boring, it’s a moneymaker with a tight dividend. Just last month, AWR approved a quarterly dividend of $0.4655 per share – its 356th consecutive dividend – which is payable on June 3 to shareholders of record as of May 19. Annualized, that’s $1.862. If you invested $25,000 in AWR, you’d take ownership of just over 322 shares. That would hand you about $599.56 per year in dividends. Helping, AWR just blew earnings out of the water. In its first quarter, EPS of 70 cents beat by three cents. Revenue of $148.01 million, up 9.4% year over year, beat by $2.16 million. Plus, analysts at Wells Fargo just upgraded AWR to an equal weight rating with a price target of $84. Target With a yield of 4.73%, Target (NYSE: TGT) is another interesting, yielding opportunity. The company just declared a quarterly dividend of $1.12 per share. Annualized that’s $4.48 per share. If you were to buy $25,000 worth of the TGT stock, you’d take ownership of just under 264 shares. Not only can you profit from potential stock price appreciation, but you can also collect an annual dividend of $1,182.72. Granted, Target has come under pressure on earnings. However, it does look like most of the negativity has been priced into the retailer. Helping, TD Cowen analysts initiated coverage of the stock with a hold rating with a price target of $105. “The analysts highlighted Target’s attractive core business, which is supported by innovative and exclusive products, as well as profitable digital fulfillment strategies with potential for scale,” as noted by Investing.com. If you want to diversify even more, there are always dividend-paying ETFs. SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 High Dividend ETF With an expense ratio of 0.07% and a yield of just under 5%, the SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:SPYD) tracks the total return performance of the S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index, which is designed to measure the performance of the top 80 high dividend stocks on the S&amp;P 500. At the moment, it has 77 holdings. Some of its top holdings include CVS Health Group, Consolidated Edison, Philip Morris, AT&amp;T, Exelon Corp., Verizon, and Altria Group to name just a few. iShares Core High Dividend ETF There’s also the iShares Core High Dividend ETF (NYSE: HDV). With an expense ratio of 0.08% and a yield of 3.36%, the HDV ETF tracks the investment results of an index composed of relatively high dividend-paying U.S. equities. Some of its 75 holdings include Exxon Mobil, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Progressive Corp., Chevron, AbbVie, Philip Morris, AT&amp;T, and Coca-Cola.

KO,2025-05-25 06:02:08,I have invested in dividends for 25 years—These stocks define my whole dividend strategy,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/i-have-invested-in-dividends-for-25-yearsthese-stocks-20250525.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Key Points You can pack your portfolio with dividend payers to juice your returns over the long run. At the same time, the cornerstone of your strategy should be solid companies, not just the biggest yield. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) One huge lesson I&#8217;ve learned during the past quarter century is that time is a dividend investor&#8217;s best friend. It&#8217;s possible to build life-changing wealth if you pick stocks that represent solid businesses, accumulate shares, and consistently reinvest the dividends for many years. The secret sauce here isn&#8217;t to chase after stocks that pay the highest dividend yields. Rather, it&#8217;s getting good yield while also focusing on companies that are growing their sales, income, or both. Thus, I&#8217;ve developed a dividend investing strategy over the past 25 years that emphasizes financially firm businesses instead of gigantic yields. So, feel free to add these rock-solid dividend deliverers to your buy-and-hold portfolio today. Lockheed Martin (LMT) As long as we live in an uncertain world, there will always be a need for national defense infrastructure. Consequently, I&#8217;ve counted on Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT) stock as a mainstay of my dividend-paying portfolio. Defense contractor Lockheed Martin is a financially solid company, I believe, because the company&#8217;s top-line and bottom-line results are moving in the right direction. Specifically, Lockheed Martin grew its first-quarter 2025 sales by 4% year over year to $17.963 billion and its net earnings by 10.8% to $1.712 billion. Unless you expect the world to live in complete peace and harmony, it makes sense to add some Lockheed Martin shares to your portfolio. Currently, the company offers a forward annual dividend yield of 2.79%. Imagine how those dividend distributions can enhance your wealth over time if you continue to reinvest them. Actually, you don&#8217;t have to imagine it because I&#8217;ll now use a historic dividend reinvestment returns calculator to show you what the results can look like. If you had invested $10,000 in Lockheed Martin stock at the beginning of the year 2000 and not reinvested the dividends, you would have grown it to $297,011.60. Yet, if you had reinvested the dividends over those 25 years, you would have grown your LMT stock investment to $441,649.89. Clearly, a minor adjustment to your strategy can make a huge difference over time. Coca-Cola (KO) What could possibly be more refreshing than an ice-cold soda from beverage giant Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO)? My answer would be: a distribution of cold, hard cash in your portfolio from Coca-Cola, a consistent dividend payer for many years. As a business, Coca-Cola has stayed financially reliable through good and bad times. For instance, in 2025&#8217;s first quarter (which included some broad-market volatility), Coca-Cola grew its organic revenue by 6% year over year and increased its earnings per share (EPS) by 5% to $0.77. What if you had invested $10,000 in KO stock at the beginning of this century? It would have been a good decision since, without reinvesting the dividends, that $10,000 would have turned into $35,271.43 by now. Reinvesting all of the dividend distributions would have been even better, though. That strategy would have grown your investment to $51,274.26, believe it or not. Today, Coca-Cola provides a 2.84% forward annual dividend yield, so don&#8217;t hesitate to take a sip of these delicious distributions in 2025. Dominion Energy (D) Throughout the ups and downs of the economy, people will undoubtedly continue to use electricity. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve counted on Dominion Energy (NYSE:D) to continue generating revenue and delivering dividend payments during the past 25 years. Dominion Energy is a large utilities company with a firm financial foothold. In Q1 of 2025, the company grew its operating revenue to $4.076 billion from $3.632 billion in the year-earlier quarter. In that same time frame, Dominion Energy increased its net income from $0.50 per share to $0.75 per share. Going back to the beginning of January 2000, a simple policy of holding Dominion Energy stock without reinvesting the dividends would have turned $10,000 to $58,013.69. That&#8217;s nothing to sneeze at, but if you had reinvested all of the dividends, that same $10,000 would have ballooned to $84,120.94. The historic returns have been amazing, but is it too late to electrify your returns with Dominion Energy stock in 2025? No way! If you want to try out my strategy of investing in financially solid businesses and reinvesting the cash distributions, feel free to purchase shares of Dominion Energy along with Lockheed Martin and Coca-Cola. While you&#8217;re at it, check out some other established dividend champions like Kimberly-Clark (NYSE:KMB) (with a forward annual dividend yield of 3.58%), Archer Daniels Midland (NYSE:ADM) (4.08%), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC) (2.32%), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). With ultra-reliable names like these in your portfolio, you can look forward to a fantastic future of outstanding, dividend-driven returns.The post I have invested in dividends for 25 years—These stocks define my whole dividend strategy appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/05/23/i-have-invested-in-dividends-for-25-years-these-stocks-define-my-whole-dividend-strategy/

These are rock-solid businesses with the ability to increase their dividends in the future. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) I started my investment journey at a young age and my secret to investing is to buy blue-chip dividend stocks. All I wanted was steady passive income and I built a portfolio of some of the Dividend Aristocrats that never let me down. No matter where you are in your investment journey, if your goal is to make money through investments, pick dividend companies. Choose companies that have a history of rewarding shareholders and you will always have income flowing into your bank account. I’ve invested in these three dividend stocks for a decade and I’ve managed to build a resilient portfolio through dividend reinvestment. Coca-Cola A blue-chip dividend stock, Coca-Cola is a globally recognized brand. Over 100 years old, the company has expanded its offerings keeping the changing consumer preferences in mind. It owns some of the most famous brands including Coke, Minute Maid, Sprite, and Fanta. The company has a long-term growth strategy driven by successful marketing, innovation, and brand strength. In the first quarter, it reported a 6% rise in organic revenue and a 5% jump in price/mix. Coca-Cola has the pricing power to remain resilient even in times of geopolitical uncertainty. Exchanging hands for $71, KO stock is up 14% year-to-date and 11% in six months. The stock’s current dividend yield is 2.87% and it has increased dividends for 63 consecutive years which speaks a lot about the management. It has an annual dividend growth rate of 5.36% and a five-year growth rate of 4.07%. Coca-Cola’s 10-year dividend growth rate is 4.67%. When I bought the stock a decade ago, its annual dividend yield was 4.12% which remained steady until 2019. Since 2019, it has remained below 4% while the annual payout has steadily increased. The annual payout amount is currently the highest in the decade at $1.94 and the annual year-over-year payout growth is 5.43% Coca-Cola has a history of delivering steady gains despite market ups and downs. The company has remained resilient in times of a pandemic, and geopolitical tensions which makes it my top choice. Walmart Inc. When I invested in Walmart in 2015, it was the most convenient way to shop. With over 4,600 locations in the U.S., I could always find a Walmart near me. Founded 8 decades ago, the company is one of the largest retailers in terms of revenue. A blue-chip stock, Walmart has never disappointed. Despite the growing popularity of e-commerce, Walmart has retained its top spot. The company has paid a regular quarterly dividend for 51 years and it has a payout ratio of 51.04% which shows that the company is reinvesting the remaining of its earnings in the business. This also means there is a potential for a higher dividend in the coming years. Walmart’s dividend yield is 0.98% and its five-year dividend growth rate is 4.41%. Its 4-year average dividend yield is 1.39%. WMT stock’s 10-year dividend growth rate is 3.26% which is lower than the sector median of 5.93% but I like the stability Walmart brings to my investment portfolio. The Dividend King boosted the dividend by 13% recently. Exchanging hands for $95, the stock is up 6.5% year to date and 47% in the year. In the first quarter, it saw a 4.5% year-over-year jump in same-store sales, and advertising sales were up 50%. Walmart is investing in e-commerce and advertising which has helped with revenue growth. Truist Securities analyst has a price target of $111 per share and a buy rating. The business is stronger than ever and I’d hold on to the stock for at least another five years. Chevron Corporation I’ve always believed that the oil and gas sector is one of the most prominent sectors of the economy. There will never be a time when the world will not need oil and this means Chevron Corporation will never run out of business. Yes, the energy industry is volatile and the changing crude oil prices impact the stock but Chevron has managed to remain steady amid the volatility. A dividend stock, the company has increased dividends for 38 consecutive years. It has an attractive dividend yield of 4.8%, higher than the industry average of 3.6%. The company has a dividend payout ratio of 70.97% showing the management’s commitment towards rewarding shareholders. The quarterly dividends have gone from $1.07 in 2015 to $1.71 in 2025. Its 10-year dividend growth rate is 4.55% while the 3-year dividend growth rate is 6.56%. Chevron stock has never disappointed. It is up 49% in 5 years but the current market volatility and the drop in crude oil prices have impacted the stock which has lost 7.78% value year-to-date. Trading for $135, the stock is very close to the 52-week low of $132 and I consider this a solid chance to buy. Crude oil prices will rise and there will always be oil demand. Chevron has several assets that will keep generating revenue, one of the most prominent ones in the Permian basin. It is a rock-solid business with an attractive balance sheet and a steady dividend payout.

Taking risks with high flying tech stocks led to dramatic gains during bull markets, but their whipsaw corrections before climbing to new highs were not for the faint of heart. The bull market of the past decade has concurrently led to the exponential proliferation of the FIRE (Financial Independence Retire Early) ethos, especially among young people. The DIY mindset, the rise of cryptocurrencies, and the spread of one click stock buying platforms from RobinHood and others have contributed to the rise of FIRE. Since it strategizes a strong work ethic, aggressive investing, a thrifty lifestyle, and an independent control over one’s retirement as the path towards a wealthy and happy post-employment life, FIRE devotees have built a movement among Millennials and Gen-Z. Too young to have experienced the dotcom bust of the 1990s, the post 9/11 market woes that presaged The Gulf War, and the 2008 subprime mortgage banking collapse, many FIRE adherents have never known a bear market. The recent reactive market turbulence to President Trump’s tariff policies have caused thousands of point swings on the Dow Jones Average, and have given a dose of investing reality to those FIRE adherents who only thought markets only went up. Discovering that their risk tolerance was weaker than anticipated, a good many FIRE adherents have turned to dividend stocks and funds with a growth component that can still deliver their FIRE objectives, albeit at a slower pace and with fewer sleepless nights. Key Points Once the hallmark of retirees and conservative baby boomer investors, dividends have gained a following among FIRE devotees. ETFs that feature solid annual growth with a dividend component can be good wealth building platforms when DRIP plans are implemented. The recent turbulence in the markets has made growth platforms with a solid dividend that implies greater stability and lower volatility even more attractive with investors of late.

Don’t waste another minute – get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF SCHD is a growth ETF with a 4% yield and lower volatility than those ETFs heavily weighted with volatile tech stocks., yet still capable of strong annual growth. In their search for an alternative to high-flying Magnificent 7 stocks or S&amp;P 500 Index ETFs heavily weighted with those stocks, the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE: SCHD) is an ETF that meets the growth and stability requirements of FIRE followers. Designed to track the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index, stock inclusion in SCHD must meet the following criteria: Minimum of 10 consecutive years of dividend payments. Floating Market Capitalization minimum of $500 minimum. Minimum Average Daily Trading Volume of $2 million. SCHD uses a 4 step calculation that takes free cash flow, total debt, return on equity, indicated annual dividend, and five year dividend growth rate to gauge a ranking. The top 100 scoring companies are included in the index. If two companies have the same score, the one with the larger dividend gets the higher ranking. At the time of this writing, other SCHD details include: Dividend Yield 4.03% Dividend Payment Frequency Quarterly Dividend Growth (trailing) 16.69% Dividend Payout Ratio 63.87% Total Assets $66.9 billion Daily Trade Volume Average 18.84 million shares Inception Date 10-20-2011 Expense Ratio 0.06% The top 5 weighted holdings in SCHD are: ConocoPhillips &#8211; 4.42% Coca-Cola &#8211; 4.41% Verizon Communications &#8211; 4.28% Lockheed Martin &#8211; 4.24% Altria Group &#8211; 4.21% The Dividend Difference As the calculator demonstrates, a $10,000 investment in SCHD back in January, 2020 would be worth $16,105.12 today, at the time of this writing, which equates to a 61.05 % ROI. The total return would be $6,105.12. . The annualized return equates to 9.24%. This calculation also includes compounding through reinvested dividends. The reinvested dividend value equates to $1,103.91. The cash dividends paid out from the initial 172.21 shares equates to $2,277.66 . If the dividends were not reinvested, the total return would be $3,375.24 . Therefore, reinvesting the dividends enabled an additional return difference of $2,729.88 over the 5 year span. The Power of Compounding Dividend compounding can be a wealth building force multiplier but also has the flexibility for fast liquidity in cases of emergency. The principles of wealth building through dollar cost averaging and compounding are standard practice among FIRE devotees. In pure growth asset scenarios, the investor needs to keep adding funds in order to fuel additional purchases. As the calculations clearly demonstrate, the dividends supplied by SCHD provide sufficient capital for buying additional shares and perpetuating growth even without the benefit of additional capital. By using dividend compounding, FIRE adherents can build wealth at an approximate 10% annual clip, and there are also additional benefits: By adding additional investment capital, an investor can multiply the growth compounding leverage on top of the dividends at their discretion. As SCHD’s dividend growth rate is continuing in double digits annually, the dividend reinvestment component will also add annual buying power to accelerate growth. The dividends from SCHD can be diverted into liquid cash should an emergency need for their deployment arise. For those still seeking a strong growth rate but with lower volatility and an income factor for greater flexibility, SCHD is a strong candidate for consideration, as the numbers display.

You can try all four of these high-yield ETFs for diversified exposure to a wide range of stocks. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) In recent years, ultra-high-yield exchange traded funds (ETFs) have opened the door to new possibilities for aggressive income harvesters. If you pick your ETFs carefully, you can practically turn your portfolio into a passive income machine. Using high-yield ETFs to generate steady income is a smart strategy, but it takes time and research to build a reliable income machine. So, to save you some of the trouble, I&#8217;ve hand-picked these four fantastic funds with big yields. Furthermore, if you give these four ETFs a try, you can cover different market sectors to diversify your portfolio. NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) If you&#8217;re on the hunt for tech-sector exposure, big yield, and frequent payouts, look no further. Truly, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) is an ambitious income investor&#8217;s dream fund. First and foremost, the QQQI ETF offers a huge distribution yield (i.e., the annualized cash payout to your portfolio) of 13.92%. This positions the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF among the most generous high-yield funds available today. Plus, there&#8217;s another reason why the QQQI ETF is a dividend achiever. Specifically, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF pays its cash distributions on a monthly basis instead of making you wait three months for the next payout. Granted, you&#8217;ll have to pay an expense ratio, which is the annualized management fee that&#8217;s automatically deducted from the fund&#8217;s share price. When it comes to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, the expense ratio is 0.68%, which is slightly high but not outrageous. Just as importantly, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF invests in components of the technology-heavy NASDAQ 100 index. With roughly 100 holdings, the QQQI ETF includes well-established tech winners like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). In other words, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF isn&#8217;t only a passive income powerhouse with a sizable yield. It&#8217;s also an easy way to diversify your portfolio across dozens of tech-market standouts, and this can add an extra layer of safety. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) In some ways, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) is similar to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. Yet, with the JEPQ ETF you&#8217;ll get the peace of mind that comes with prestigious management from financial giant JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM). Like the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF focuses on the NASDAQ 100. JEPQ has 108 stocks in its holdings, and the fund is strongly weighted toward large-cap technology stocks (Apple, Amazon, Microsoft, and so on). Also, just like the QQQI ETF, the JEPQ ETF pays out its distributions on a monthly basis. However, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 11.01%, which isn&#8217;t quite as high as the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF&#8217;s gigantic 13.92% distribution yield. On the other hand, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF brings you active management from the one and only JPMorgan Chase. That&#8217;s a safety feature to consider, and the fund&#8217;s expense ratio is only 0.35%. Therefore, you might consider leveraging the expertise of a legendary asset manager with the comparatively low-fee JEPQ ETF. NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (SPYI) Mind you, I didn&#8217;t turn my portfolio into a passive income machine by only investing in NASDAQ 100 based funds. Indeed, I diversified my holdings even further with a very broad-based fund known as the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI). Like QQQI and JEPQ, SPYI pays out its distributions each and every month. Yet, unlike those other two funds, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is based on the S&amp;P 500 rather than the NASDAQ 100. With around 500 stocks in its holdings, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is more diversified than QQQI and JEPQ. You&#8217;ll get exposure to tech names like Apple and NVIDIA with the SPYI ETF, but you&#8217;ll also participate in the growth of non-technology-sector businesses like Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). For active management and the enhanced safety that comes with wide portfolio breadth, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF charges an expense ratio of 0.68%. However, the fund&#8217;s hefty 12.11% annual distribution rate more than makes up for the management fees, so SPYI is a great choice for monthly income seekers. YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (MSTY) Finally, after focusing on safety and diversification with the first three ETFs, now we can ramp up the risk-and-reward profile with a fourth fund. I&#8217;m referring to an aggressive but fascinating fund known as the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSTY). You won&#8217;t get much diversification with the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. Instead, you&#8217;ll get an annual expense ratio of 0.99% and an eye-watering distribution rate of 143.11%. The fund achieves this through actively trading U.S. Treasury bonds and options on Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock. As you may be aware, Microstrategy stock is volatile and involves a great deal of risk. You&#8217;ll get sizable monthly distributions with MSTY, but a downturn in MSTR stock could be problematic for your portfolio. Because this fund is very risky, my passive income machine only includes a few shares of the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF. For a more favorable safety-and-yield mix, consider taking a larger position in SPYI, a smaller stake in QQQI and JEPQ, and a tiny position in MSTY.The post These 4 Dividend ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, MSTY) Are Passive Income Machines appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/06/02/these-4-dividend-etfs-qqqi-jepq-spyi-msty-are-passive-income-machines/

Five fascinating funds will tempt income seekers with potent yields and strong growth prospects. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Stock picking is fine, but exchange traded funds (ETFs) can enable immediate diversification without sacrificing growth and income opportunities. By selecting multiple funds instead of just one, you can achieve an extra measure of safety while also turning your portfolio into a veritable income-generating machine. The idea is to pick out ETFs with notable distribution yields (i.e., annualized cash payment percentages), but also to focus on a wide variety of funds with share-price growth potential. Now, let&#8217;s drill down on five fabulous ETFs so you can start accumulating shares for your income-machine portfolio today. NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (QQQI) The name of the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) might lead you to assume that this fund only offers a hefty yield. There&#8217;s more to the story, though, as the QQQI ETF also enables investors to participate in strong technology-focused growth opportunities. Based on the NASDAQ 100 stock index with approximately 100 holdings, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF includes many large-cap tech names you&#8217;ll surely recognize. Some examples are NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). There&#8217;s no denying that technology giants like Apple and NVIDIA are robust revenue generators. Consequently, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF share price could grow substantially over the long term. At the same time, many investors flock to the QQQI ETF for its eye-catching 13.92% distribution yield. Granted, the fund subtracts an annualized management fee (also known as the expense ratio) of 0.68% from the share price. Still, even after the expense ratio is taken out, investors can look forward to outstanding annual income with the QQQI ETF. Along with that, you&#8217;ll get to participate in the growth prospects of terrific tech titans when you hold the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (JEPQ) There&#8217;s another passive income machine that&#8217;s similar to QQQI, but it&#8217;s not identical. Brought to you by famous financier JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) squeezes extra income from a range of high-confidence technology leaders. Much like the QQQI ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF focuses on the NASDAQ 100 and includes around 100 stocks (108, to be exact). From Microsoft to Apple, Amazon, and many more, you&#8217;ll find plenty of high-growth tech names in JEPQ. There&#8217;s a trade-off with the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF when compared to the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. On the negative side, JEPQ has a rolling 12-month dividend yield of 11.01%, which isn’t as impressive as QQQI&#8217;s 13.92% distribution yield. On the positive side, however, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF has an annualized expense ratio of 0.35%. This is lower than the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF&#8217;s 0.68% annual management fee. Perhaps most importantly, you&#8217;ll have the reassurance that comes with well-established fund management by JPMorgan Chase. Thus, for an interesting alternative to the QQQI ETF, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF is absolutely worth considering. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Maybe you&#8217;re seeking a passive income machine that&#8217;s not as technology-heavy as QQQI and JEPQ. In that case, you&#8217;ll want to check out the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This fund includes has 103 stocks in its portfolio, but SCHD doesn&#8217;t track the NASDAQ 100 index. Instead, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. Take a look at the fund’s top 10 holdings and you’ll find some technology firms, such as Cisco Systems (NASDAQ:CSCO) and Texas Instruments (NASDAQ:TXN). Yet, you&#8217;ll also see names from other sectors, including Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Conoco Phillips (NYSE:COP). Moreover, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF offers a trailing 12-month distribution yield of 3.72% with an annual expense ratio of just 0.06%. The ultra-low management fees allow investors to grow their accounts steadily with the SCHD ETF. Two More Picks for Low Volatility To cap off this list of passive income machine picks, I&#8217;ve got two relatively low-risk funds to show you. First, there&#8217;s an ETF that concentrates on dividend-growing businesses instead of gigantic yield. The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO) features a 4.81% annual distribution rate but also a 0.56% expense ratio, so the income opportunities are good but not jaw-dropping. On the other hand, DIVO tends to be low-volatility as it holds a diverse array of safe names, such as Home Depot, Visa (NYSE:V), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Microsoft, and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF emphasizes &#8220;high-quality large cap companies with a history of dividend and earnings growth.&#8221; This approach will typically reduce share-price volatility, so investors can sleep well at night while collecting passive income with DIVO. In a similar vein, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI) is de-risked because it holds well-known large-cap stocks in multiple sectors. Indeed, SPYI might be the least risky fund on this list as it includes approximately 500 stocks in its holdings. Because the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF generates income from the S&amp;P 500 index, it is a widely diversified fund. So, there&#8217;s a safety factor built into the SPYI ETF. In addition, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF is an enticing passive income machine with a 12.11% annual distribution rate. The fund&#8217;s 0.68% annual expense ratio isn&#8217;t super-low, but the fees may be justified as SPYI brings high yield and instant diversification to the table. All in all, I like DIVO and SPYI for reduced volatility, SCHD for low management fees, and QQQI and JEPQ for technology-sector exposure.The post These 5 ETFs (QQQI, JEPQ, SCHD, DIVO, SPYI) Are Passive Income Machines appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/06/03/these-5-etfs-qqqi-jepq-schd-divo-spyi-are-passive-income-machines/

As investors navigate the turbulent waters of tariff-driven volatility in 2025, dividend stocks have emerged as a safe harbor, delivering superior returns compared to the broader market. While the default strategy might be to anchor portfolios with blue-chip payers like Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO) and Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ), smart money might also look to small-cap stocks. These smaller companies, typically with market caps under $2 billion, often possess untapped potential and the capacity for substantial upside due to their lower starting valuations. Our research has uncovered three intriguing small-cap dividend stocks, all trading below $50 per share, that appear poised for potential future appreciation. It&#8217;s true that small-cap investments come with elevated risk, but the potential rewards can be equally substantial. While we lack a crystal ball, these selected companies have demonstrated promising performance and attractive dividend yields. We acknowledge that some of these selections may have grown slightly beyond the conventional $2 billion small-cap threshold; however, their continued presence in prominent small-cap ETFs confirms their relevance to this segment. Key Points Kodiak Gas Services (KGS): High 5.1% yield, strong EBITDA growth, and analyst upgrades support potential return to 52-week highs. Buckle (BKE): Zero debt, rising same-store sales, and 16% margins make it a resilient small-cap retail dividend pick. Farmers National (FMNB): 5.1% yield, strong Q1 earnings growth, and expanding deposits highlight this undervalued small-cap bank’s upside. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement?

Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Kodiak Gas Services (NYSE: KGS) There are a couple of reasons to like Kodiak Gas Services (NYSE: KGS) stock. At $36 per share, Kodiak offers a high dividend yield of 5.1%. Given its market capitalization of $3.1 billion, Kodiak is in the gray area for small-cap stocks but is included in Fidelity&#8217;s Small Cap Dividend Growth Fund. In Q2 2025, Kodiak announced an increase to its quarterly cash dividend to $0.45 per share, up 10% compared with Q4 2024 levels. If you were to purchase 100 shares of KGS stock at current levels and hold it for 10 years with DRIP, based on the latest performance, you could expect a total return of 57.3% as well as annual dividend income of $256.19. Over the past 12 months, Kodiak stock is up approximately 38.4%, though it continues to trade below its 52-week high of $50 per share. In its most recent quarterly results, Kodiak lifted the range of its full-year adjusted EBITDA guidance in response to what management described as an &#8220;outstanding quarter.&#8221; With these positive catalysts, the stock could revisit recent highs sooner rather than later. Wall Street analysts are increasingly optimistic about Kodiak stock. Most recently, Stifel increased its price target on the stock by $1 to $46 per share with a &#8220;buy&#8221; rating attached. The analyst firm said that despite an uncertain macroeconomic backdrop, Kodiak is full speed ahead in the Permian basin, where it compresses natural gas for pipeline transportation. Buckle (NYSE: BKE) With a dividend yield of 3.2%, specialty retailer Buckle (NYSE: BKE) makes a quarterly distribution of $0.35 per share. The stock currently trades for approximately $42 per share, in the midpoint of its 52-week range. Wall Street analysts mostly advise holding the stock, with an average price target of $40 per share. The markets may be underappreciating BKE stock considering the company&#8217;s strong balance sheet. Buckle carries zero long-term debt. By purchasing 100 shares of BKE at current levels, and holding for 10 years with DRIP, you could expect annual dividend income of just over $191 and more than just a preservation of capital. Buckle recently reported a 6.1% jump in its same-store sales for the four-week period leading up to early May and has also been experiencing an increase in online sales. The company&#8217;s net sales in the same period increased 7% to $85.5 million. This performance is a shift from a tough 2024 in which revenues were on a downward trajectory. For example, in the first three quarters of 2024, Buckle suffered a 5% decline in revenues. But 2025 is off to a good start. In Q1, Buckle reported net income of $35.2 million, or $0.70 per share. Buckle competes with the likes of Target and Amazon but still manages an attractive profit margin of nearly 16%. If Buckle can keep up this performance, it might have further upside potential and could be worth a spot in a dividend investor&#8217;s portfolio. Farmers National (Nasdaq: FMNB) Canfield, Ohio-based Farmers National (Nasdaq: FMNB) stock trades for just over $13 per share. The company has a dividend yield of 5.1%. In May 2025, Farmers National recently declared its latest quarterly dividend of $0.17 per share. Wall Street has an average price target of $15 on Farmers National stock, reflecting upside potential of approximately 13%. FMNB stock is held by big institutions including BlackRock, Vanguard LSV Asset Management. With a purchase of 100 shares at current levels, and holding for 10 years with DRIP, you could expect annual dividend income of just over $111 and a total return of roughly 66% over that period. In Q1 2025, Farmers National reported net income of $13.6 million compared with $11.2 million year-over-year. Farmers National CEO Kevin Helmick described the bank&#8217;s &#8220;position of strength,&#8221; pointing to a &#8220;legacy of profitability, strong asset quality and robust liquidity levels&#8221; despite economic uncertainty. Farmers has growing customer deposits and has been expanding its footprint into new markets, the most recent of which was Columbus, Ohio. Investors who might want exposure to financial services might want to consider Farmers National for its steady dividend and potential for capital appreciation.

Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Ever since I started my investment journey, dividend stocks have remained a favorite, and for good reason. I enjoy the steady passive income and reinvest the dividends to keep the money growing. With hundreds of dividend-paying companies in the industry, it is possible to choose high-yield stocks that have a steady record of rewarding shareholders and an ability to sustain dividends, even in tough times. The stock market has shown volatility since the start of the year amid recession concerns and tariff uncertainty. I continue to choose stocks that provide safety and passive income. I’ve invested in these dividend stocks for 15 years and they have become a core part of my passive income plan. These companies can not only sustain the dividends but also increase them in the coming years. Here are my top picks. Johnson &amp; Johnson A dividend portfolio remains incomplete without Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). One of the top healthcare stocks, the company is an exceptional brand with a global presence and a unique product line. The company has a lineup of medicines across different areas including oncology, neuroscience, and immunology. It holds more than 10 drugs which generate about $1 billion in sales each year. In the first quarter, the company saw a 2.4% jump in sales to $21.9 billion and it has increased the full-year sales guidance. Its EPS stood at $4.54 and the majority of the sales were driven by the innovative medicine segment. Additionally, the company has an impressive pipeline of drugs which means the company will keep growing even if the revenue increases at a slower pace. It also has the pricing power to handle negotiations with the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The company has increased dividends for 63 consecutive years and currently has a yield of approximately 3.1%. Johnson &amp; Johnson has been around for over a century and it has seen it all. The healthcare leader is known as a Dividend King for a reason. 3M Another top pick, 3M (NYSE:MMM) is a highly diversified business and provides services in multiple industries. The company has four segments, namely, transportation, healthcare, safety, and industrial and consumer. The company achieved an organic sales growth of 1.5% and an EPS of $1.88, up 10% year over year in the first quarter. It reported slower growth but the management is expecting better earnings in the coming quarters. 3M is focusing on operational improvements to turn around the business. Trading for $149, the stock is up 15% year-to-date and 51% in 12 months. Despite the weak sales environment and ongoing market volatility, 3M hasn’t disappointed investors. CEO Bill Brown has laid out several initiatives to turn the business around. He is focusing on revitalizing new product introductions, which could improve sales growth and margins. MMM enjoys a dividend yield of 1.97% and has increased dividends for 65 years. While the short-term outlook may not look attractive, 3M is for long-term investors and its dividends are worth watching out for. There is no doubt that the industry is operating in an environment that is highly volatile right now. However, if the economic outlook improves through the de-escalation of the trade conflict, 3M has the potential to see higher sales and revenue. Coca Cola The top beverage giant is a favorite of Warren Buffett and he holds over 400 million shares in the company. Coke (NYSE: KO) is a highly diversified business with the most valuable brands including Sprite, Minute Maid, Fanta, and Diet Coke. In the first quarter, Coca-Cola reported sales of $11.22 billion and an EPS of 73 cents. Despite a 2% drop in net sales, the company saw a 6% rise in organic revenue. The management has maintained the full-year forecast and expects the tariff disruptions to be manageable. Despite the tariffs, it is a well-shielded company that will keep paying you each quarter. The company has raised dividends for over six decades and enjoys a yield of 2.84%. It announced a 5.2% year-over-year rise in the quarterly per-share payout and the company has the ability to afford to keep paying dividends. KO stock is exchanging hands for $71 and is up 16% year-to-date. This is a solid dividend stock to buy under $100. The name, reliability, and the global presence make Coca-Cola a top dividend king to own. I have held Coca-Cola for over 15 years and I am nowhere near giving up on it. Procter &amp; Gamble One of the largest consumer products companies, Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) has become a household name today. It is a leader in healthcare, beauty and grooming, and baby and family care. The company owns some of the biggest brands including Pampers, Gillette, Tide, Olay, and Pantene. Since it doesn’t rely on a particular country, brand, or category, it has a heavily diversified business that will keep generating revenue. It is in a better position to handle tariff-related issues and inflationary pressure. In the recently announced results, the company reported a 2% rise in net sales and a 3% jump in organic revenue. Its EPS came in at $1.88 and the management has reiterated the full-year outlook. Exchanging hands for $167, PG stock is flat year-to-date and up 2.8% in 12 months. The stock is far from cheap, it has a P/E ratio of 26.64, higher than its 10-year median of 25.7 but paying a premium for the stock might be worthwhile in an uncertain environment like today. The company has a dividend yield of 2.52% and it has increased dividends for 69 consecutive years. If you want to play super-safe, this is the Dividend king to own.

Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Put your money to work and make it make you money. Unfortunately, it’s not going to make you much money in a standard low-yielding savings account. But it can make you a good deal of consistent money if you invest wisely in higher-yielding Dividend King stocks. Not only are you investing in reliable growth, but you’re also investing in a company with reliable dividends. Look at Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO), for example. The company just approved its 63rd consecutive annual dividend increase, raising its quarterly dividend to 51 cents per share. It’s considered a Dividend King because it’s been paying out a dividend for more than 50 years. In KO’s case, it’s been distributing yield since 1971. Today, if you bought $25,000 worth of the KO stock, you would take ownership of 349 shares. With a $2.04 annual payout, you can sit back and collect about $712 in yearly income. And all you had to do was buy and hold a popular stock. As for other Dividend Kings to consider, here are three you may want to buy today. Pepsico With a yield of 4.3%, Pepsico (NASDAQ: PEP) is a familiar name with a strong, dependable yield. PEP has now raised its dividend for the 53rd time since 1965. Most recently, PEP paid out a quarterly dividend of $1.4225 per share – a 5% increase year over year – on June 30. Annualized, that’s $5.69. So, if you invest $25,000 in PEP now, you can take ownership of about 188 shares. You’re buying a dependable company with years of success. And, using today’s PEP price of $132.60, you can collect $1,069.72 in yearly income just by holding the PEP stock. Helping, analysts at RBC just reiterated a sector perform rating on the stock with a target price of $163 per share. We also have to consider the company is investing in inorganic growth as it gets more involved with healthier food and beverages. For example, PEP just acquired Poppi – a healthy soda brand – for $1.95 billion. American States Water With a yield of 2.41%, Dividend King, American States Water (NYSE: AWR) provides water and electric services with a strong history of consistent dividend increases. It’s paid out a dividend every year since 1931. While it may sound boring, it’s a moneymaker with a tight dividend. Just last month, AWR approved a quarterly dividend of $0.4655 per share – its 356th consecutive dividend – which is payable on June 3 to shareholders of record as of May 19. Annualized, that’s $1.862. If you invested $25,000 in AWR, you’d take ownership of just over 322 shares. That would hand you about $599.56 per year in dividends. Helping, AWR just blew earnings out of the water. In its first quarter, EPS of 70 cents beat by three cents. Revenue of $148.01 million, up 9.4% year over year, beat by $2.16 million. Plus, analysts at Wells Fargo just upgraded AWR to an equal weight rating with a price target of $84. Target With a yield of 4.73%, Target (NYSE: TGT) is another interesting, yielding opportunity. The company just declared a quarterly dividend of $1.12 per share. Annualized that’s $4.48 per share. If you were to buy $25,000 worth of the TGT stock, you’d take ownership of just under 264 shares. Not only can you profit from potential stock price appreciation, but you can also collect an annual dividend of $1,182.72. Granted, Target has come under pressure on earnings. However, it does look like most of the negativity has been priced into the retailer. Helping, TD Cowen analysts initiated coverage of the stock with a hold rating with a price target of $105. “The analysts highlighted Target’s attractive core business, which is supported by innovative and exclusive products, as well as profitable digital fulfillment strategies with potential for scale,” as noted by Investing.com. If you want to diversify even more, there are always dividend-paying ETFs. SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 High Dividend ETF With an expense ratio of 0.07% and a yield of just under 5%, the SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:SPYD) tracks the total return performance of the S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Index, which is designed to measure the performance of the top 80 high dividend stocks on the S&amp;P 500. At the moment, it has 77 holdings. Some of its top holdings include CVS Health Group, Consolidated Edison, Philip Morris, AT&amp;T, Exelon Corp., Verizon, and Altria Group to name just a few. iShares Core High Dividend ETF There’s also the iShares Core High Dividend ETF (NYSE: HDV). With an expense ratio of 0.08% and a yield of 3.36%, the HDV ETF tracks the investment results of an index composed of relatively high dividend-paying U.S. equities. Some of its 75 holdings include Exxon Mobil, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Progressive Corp., Chevron, AbbVie, Philip Morris, AT&amp;T, and Coca-Cola.

In contrast, the QQQI ETF pays frequent dividends and tempts investors with a huge annual yield. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) How do you define a &#8220;better&#8221; exchange traded funds (ETF) for passive income investors? You might prefer an ETF with an established track record of dividend growth. Alternatively, you may choose a fund that offers a higher dividend yield and pays its distributions more often. Your financial freedom could depend on your ability to pick out the right high-yield dividend ETFs for your portfolio. Two popular income-focused funds are superior to most, but investors should know the crucial differences between them. Knowledge is power, so let&#8217;s dig deep into the fantastic features of two high-powered dividend ETFs for 2025. SCHD for Dividend Growth Maybe you&#8217;ve heard about dividend funds that put cash in your account each and every month. To be completely honest, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD) isn&#8217;t one of those funds. The fact is, Schwab&#8217;s U.S. Dividend Equity ETF pays out its cash distributions to investors once every three months. On the other hand, the fund&#8217;s yield is quite good, so patient shareholders will be richly rewarded. There are 103 stocks in the SCHD ETF&#8217;s holdings, and this fund tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. Consequently, if you own the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, you&#8217;ll get exposure to stocks covering a wide variety of market sectors. In other words, there&#8217;s a safety factor with the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF because it&#8217;s highly diversified. Browse through the fund&#8217;s holdings list and you&#8217;ll recognize all kinds of famous names, such as Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Lockheed Martin (NYSE:LMT), and Chevron (NYSE:CVX). Now, you may have noticed that the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF includes not just dividend payers, but also many dividend growers. As a result, while I can&#8217;t promise that the SCHD ETF will increase its dividends every quarter, I can say that the fund historically grew its dividend payments over the long term. It&#8217;s exciting to consider that the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF&#8217;s dividend payments might continue to grow in the coming years. The fund already features a trailing 12-month distribution yield (i.e., a dividend yield) of 4.03%, which is certainly eye-catching. Furthermore, SCHD only takes an expense ratio (i.e., an annual management fee) of 0.06%. All in all, you can get decent quarterly dividends and low-cost diversification with the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF. Monthly Cash Payouts with QQQI Dividend growth is great, and it&#8217;s always nice to have an added layer of safety that comes with broad market sector diversification. However, while the SCHD ETF has its advantages, ultra-high yield seekers may prefer the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI). The annual expense ratio for the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF is 0.68%, and this is much higher than the 0.06% expense ratio of Schwab&#8217;s U.S. Dividend Equity ETF. When you learn about QQQI&#8217;s huge expected annual yield, though, you might still choose this fund over SCHD. After glancing at the full holdings list for the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF, I discovered that the fund has around 100 stocks. They&#8217;re mostly large-cap technology stocks, which makes sense because the QQQI ETF invests in constituents of the NASDAQ 100 stock index. Compared to SCHD, which has holdings spread across numerous market sectors, you won&#8217;t get as much diversification with the tech-heavy NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. So, why should anyone prefer QQQI, which has higher management fees and may be less safe during a market downturn? One reason to choose the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF is that the fund pays out its cash distributions every month instead of just one every quarter. Therefore, QQQI&#8217;s shareholders have more chances to reinvest the distributions and multiply the effect of compounding. That&#8217;s not the only advantage of the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. This fund also boasts an annual yield that&#8217;s superior to SCHD&#8217;s 4.03%. In fact, the currently expected annual distribution rate for the QQQI ETF is a whopping 15.35%. SCHD vs. QQQI: Different Strokes for Different Folks Some investors might claim that the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF has a greater margin of safety since its yield is substantially bigger. The point is that you&#8217;ll get a nice cash cushion every month with QQQI &#8212; very little waiting required. What you&#8217;ll get with the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, however, is dividends that will probably grow over the long term. Plus, you&#8217;ll get instant diversification with minuscule management fees if you own SCHD. The &#8220;winner,&#8221; then, is the fund that fits your objectives. Do you want huge yield very soon, or dividend growth prospects for the future? After some reflection, you might decide that you want both. That&#8217;s fine as you can choose to own some shares of the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF and a few shares of NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF. With this approach, there&#8217;s no need to limit yourself as SCHD and QQQI can both be wealth-building &#8220;winners&#8221; for your portfolio.The post SCHD vs. QQQI: Dividend Growth or Monthly Cash—What’s Better? appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/06/10/schd-vs-qqqi-dividend-growth-or-monthly-cash-whats-better/

KO,2025-06-17 12:02:36,Warren Buffett’s Best Investment Quote,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/warren-buffetts-best-investment-quote-20250617.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"A recent list of Warren Buffett’s best quotes includes his primary view of investing. It represents sound advice that is as good as that provided by any seasoned investor: &#8220;The first rule of an investment is don&#8217;t lose (money). And the second rule of an investment is don&#8217;t forget the first rule. And that&#8217;s all the rules there are.&#8221; 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: One of Warren Buffett’s best pieces of investment advice is not to lose money. He may have lost money on some investments, but not enough to offset his overall spectacular returns. Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) A $100 investment in his flagship company, Berkshire Hathaway Inc. (NYSE: BRK-B), which he took over in 1965, was worth $5.5 million at the end of last year. Some of this growth is due to financial companies that he favors and has acquired. This includes insurance company GEICO and several reinsurance companies. However, the largest private corporation he owns is the massive railroad Burlington Northern Santa Fe Company. Two investments demonstrate the diversification of Buffett’s holdings. One is Apple Inc. (NASDAQ: AAPL) (some of which he sold off recently), and the other is the Chinese EV company BYD. He purchased many of his BYD shares in 2008 when the company was still an obscure carmaker. That investment of $230 million is worth $2.4 billion. BYD sells more EVs than Tesla does. Some of his investments are in America’s oldest companies. These are also some of America’s valuable and visible brands. Coca-Cola Co. (NYSE: KO) was launched in 1886. Berkshire Hathaway was a significant company before Buffett took over in 1965. Kroger Inc. (NYSE: KR) was founded in 1883. American Express Co. (NYSE: AXP) got its start in 1850. All were part of Buffett’s holdings in the first quarter of 2025. He has held some of these for most of this century. These represent part of his investment rules and philosophies. Often among the best investments are companies that have been industry giants and successful since before Buffett was born in 1930. He and his staff can examine earnings, business models, and both good and bad decisions. He can look at CEOs, both present and past, and he can sift through balance sheets. Buffett has observed the strategies of their competitors and has seen how these companies navigate business cycles, both good and bad. To be clear, Buffett likes to invest in companies that are relatively new and have been the winners in the new world of tech. This includes, among others, Amazon and Apple. As he watched Apple stock tumble, he sold off some of those holdings. Buffett has lost money on some investments, but not enough to dent his overall spectacular returns.

These three popular ETFs will never disappoint you. Each ETF is highly diversified, low-cost, low risk and pays steady dividends. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Market volatility in 2025 has driven investors towards safer assets like exchange-traded funds (ETFs). By investing in ETFs, you not only build a highly diversified portfolio but also generate steady income and hold some of the top companies. You do not have to pick individual stocks to make money. ETFs are a low-cost option of investing in stocks and they reduce company-specific risks. If you’re looking for the best ETFs to invest in this year, I’ve identified 3 where I’d put my $10,000 today. Since no two funds are equal, you need to weigh each based on your personal financial goals and risk appetite. JP Morgan Equity Premium ETF The J.P. Morgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI) is a covered call ETF that invests in the top S&amp;P 500 stocks. These stocks are known for little risk and steady returns. It offers a monthly payout and invests in the top U.S. blue-chip companies. The ETF enjoys an attractive 30-day SEC yield of 11.38% and holds 126 stocks. Since it is a covered call ETF, the fund buys stocks and then sells call options on them, this gives the buyers a chance to make a profit. While investors get a share in some profits, most are drawn to the high dividend yield. JEPI has an expense ratio of 0.35% and its NAV is $56.04. The ETF has remained flat in the year but the dividend yield makes it worth a consideration. Since it owns elite names and holds dividend-paying companies, it ensures a steady income for investors. Its holdings include: Information Technology: 15.8% Financials: 13% Industrials: 12.8% Healthcare: 11.3% The ETF also owns some of the Magnificent Seven, namely, Nvidia, Microsoft, and Tesla. None of the stocks have a weightage higher than 2%. Despite investing the majority of the funds in the tech sector, JEPI reduces the sector-specific risks with its highly diversified portfolio. Even if the ETF moves sideways in the short term, investors can benefit from the steady passive income. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF If you are looking for a fund that is not tech-heavy, the Schwab U.S. Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD) is a smart choice. The fund offers the potential for income and growth. It holds 103 stocks and tracks the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 index. It has an expense ratio of 0.06% and a 30-day SEC yield of 3.81%. While the ETF has a slightly lower dividend yield, it offers capital appreciation. The NAV of the fund is $26.90 and it is up 4.38% in 12 months and over 50% in five years. The fund holdings include: Energy: 21.08% Consumer staples: 19.06% Healthcare: 15.68% Industrials: 12.45% None of the stocks in the ETF have a weightage higher than 5% and the top holdings include popular names like Cisco, ConocoPhillips, Texas Instruments, Coca-Cola, and Chevron Corporation. These are some of the dividend-paying companies. If you’re a passive income investor looking for a low-risk investment option, SCHD is a great choice. The ETF offers a wide range of top-quality dividend stocks to help build your passive income portfolio. SCHD isn’t tech-heavy, meaning you do not have to worry about your returns during volatility. The highly diversified portfolio owns elite names and pay quarterly dividends. JP Morgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF The JP Morgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ: JEPQ) invests in the Nasdaq 100 and holds stocks that have little volatility. It holds 108 stocks and has a 30-day SEC yield of 14.47%. JEPQ has an expense ratio of 0.35% and focuses heavily on tech. The fund holdings include: Information technology: 42.4% Other: 16.5% Communication services: 12.9% Consumer discretionary: 12.1% I believe that the future is tech and by investing in JEPQ, it is possible to reduce the company-specific risks while holding the top tech giants like Nvidia, Apple, Tesla, and Microsoft. The top 10 stocks in the fund form 44.34% of the portfolio and these are tech companies except for Costco. The tech sector has rallied in the past and once the economy improves, we could see it pick pace again. JEPQ has an NAV of $52.59 and is down 4.87% in 12 months. Since the fund focuses on high yield, the capital appreciation could be limited. However, I believe the fund has the potential to keep rewarding investors with a solid yield. JEPI and JEPQ both have a solid dividend yield and the fund is handled by the experts at JP Morgan, making it low-risk and highly reliable. JEPQ pays monthly dividends and offers a balanced portfolio of elite heavyweights. The low-stress ETF is one of the best placess to invest $10,000 today.

As the tail end of the Baby Boomer generation reaches the qualifying full retirement age, a considerable number of those entering or already enjoying retirement need to find a balance in their time management. Specifically, they need to find equilibrium between the time they devote to managing their retirement portfolios and the time they spend on travel, hobbies and other opportunities that were hindered by employment responsibilities. For those seeking to devote a minimum amount of work to the former while simultaneously being able to enjoy the latter (without undue daily financial worries), two Charles Schwab’s exchange-traded funds (ETFs) have proven to be a popular solution since the 1990s. For thousands of retirees who want to combine a growth component with mitigated volatility, diversification and income, the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD) has become a popular choice. Taking the diversification aspect one step further, there are dozens of financial investment opportunities every day taking place around the globe that often go totally unnoticed and unreported in financial media. For those investors seeking international exposure for their portfolios with a comparable degree of growth, income, diversification and risk containment, the Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHY) may appeal to them. Key Points in This Article: These two dividend-focused Schwab ETFs can provide a reliable stream of retirement income. While both provided strong yield, SCHD and SCHY are also focused on dividend growth. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement?

(Sponsor) Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF Among retirees, the Schwab US Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE: SCHD) is an ETF that meets the growth, income and stability requirements of many portfolios that are providing living expense funds for those in their golden years. Designed to track the Dow Jones US Dividend 100 Index, stocks under consideration for inclusion in SCHD must meet the following criteria: Minimum of 10 consecutive years of dividend payments Floating market capitalization minimum of $500 minimum Minimum average daily trading volume of $2 million Schwab deploys a four-step calculation that determines ranking, which may differ from that of the Dow Jones US Dividend 100 Index: Cash flow-to-total dDebt ratio Return on equity Dividend yield Five-year dividend growth rate The top 100 scoring companies are included in the index. If two companies have the same score, the one with the larger dividend gets the higher ranking. At the time of this writing, other SCHD details include: Dividend Yield 3.97% Dividend Payment Frequency Quarterly Dividend Growth (trailing) 16.69% Dividend Payout Ratio 56.99% Total Assets $68.16 billion Daily Trade Volume Average 18.26 million shares Inception Date 10-20-2011 Expense Ratio 0.06% 1-year trailing return 3.92% 3-year trailing return 3.77% 5-year trailing return 12.23% 10-year trailing return 10.58% The top five weighted holdings in SCHD exemplify how the ETF provides investors with exposure to numerous sectors: Coca-Cola: 4.35% Verizon Communications: 4.34% Altria Group: 4.30% Lockheed Martin: 4.26% Cisco Systems: 4.17% The top five weighted sectors in SCHD are: Consumer defensive: 19.65% Energy: 18.80% Health care: 14.55% Industrials: 11.13% Technology: 10.76% A minimum of 90% of the stocks in the SCHD portfolio are also in the Dow Jones US Dividend 100 Index, although rankings may differ. Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF For equivalent levels of criteria selection, growth potential, income, and stability in an international ETF, the Schwab International Dividend Equity ETF (NYSE: SCHY) complements SCHD very seamlessly in a portfolio. Similarly to SCHD, SCHY will only consider companies with a minimum unbroken 10-year track record of dividend payouts, as well as market cap and liquidity parameters. The next 4 calculated elements determine rankings: Cash flow-to-total debt ratio Return on equity Dividend yield Five-year dividend growth rate The top 400 stocks that make the cut are then calculated for historical price volatility, and those that exceed the overall average are eliminated from the running. The final 100 that make the cut that are added to the portfolio, under the following weighting caps, which are adjusted and rebalanced each quarter: No individual stock weighting to exceed 4% No sector weighting to exceed 15% Any emerging market sector stocks cannot collectively exceed 15% Dividend Yield 3.89% Dividend Payment Frequency Quarterly Dividend Growth (trailing 3-years)) 20.29% Dividend Payout Ratio 54.80% Total Assets $1.1 billion Daily Trade Volume Average 361,208 shares Inception Date 10-20-2011 Expense Ratio 0.08% 1-year trailing return 15.46% 3-year trailing return 7.67% 5-year trailing return N/A 10-year trailing return N/A Like SCHD, the top five weighted holdings in SCHY also span numerous sectors: Enel SpA: 4.69% Wesfarmers Ltd.: 4.22% Vinci SA: 4.18% British American Tobacco: 4.04% Unilever: 4.02% The top five weighted sectors in SCHY are: Consumer defensive: 15.82% Financial services: 15.33% Communications services: 13.15% Industrials: 12.07% Health care: 11.44% Some Strategies to Keep in Mind Selection for asset liquidations mandated under RMD rules should be submitted to careful deliberation in order to maintain income stream while preserving sufficient growth to keep up with inflation. Retirees that are relying on their portfolio for their living expense income will likely want to keep the following tips in mind if adding SCHD and/or SCHY to an IRA: SCHD dividends are qualified dividends, meaning that they qualify for taxations at lower capital gains rates than as income. As dividends from SCHY are from international companies, portions of those dividends may not qualify, depending on criteria such as if the stock meets the minimum 61-day holding threshold from the ETF, etc. A tax-professional should likely be consulted if there are any questions. Required minimum distribution (RMD) mandates commence when an account holder reaches age 73. Depending on what other assets are in the portfolio, the long term viability of SCHD and SCHY to continue steady growth and continued reliable income should be weighed against any other assets to determine if they should be incrementally liquidated to meet RMD dictates, or if other growth assets might be more suitable. The combination of growth, income and diversity offered from SCHD and SCHY might weather future market turbulence better than other assets which might be more geared for growth or only for income, and thus more vulnerable.

Considering more than 200 countries sell Coke products with customers drinking 1.8 billion beverages every day, it’s long been one of the world’s most valuable brands. Key Points Coca-Cola has long been one of the world’s most popular drinks. The company famously didn’t raise prices for more than 70 years. The recipe for Coca-Cola remains one of the most heavily guarded secrets in the world. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) First introduced in 1886, Coca-Cola was one of the few companies that maintained its price for a long time. While the price has changed since, it’s remarkable to know that Coca-Cola was so confident in its customers&#8217; love for the product that it remained profitable at the same price for decades. 12. 1886 &#8211; 1950 Coca-Cola&#8217;s price remained unchanged for 70 years. The price of Coca-Cola was famously fixed at a nickel between 1886 and 1959. For just $0.05, you could purchase a 6.5-ounce Coke for the same price for years to come. Coca-Cola has indicated that, due to bottling contracts originating in 1899 and the advent of vending machine technology, along with a low rate of inflation, it was able to sustain this price for almost 70 years. 11. 1955 Even in 1955, you could still find Coca-Cola for a nickel. For many reasons, it’s surprising how well Coca-Cola was able to maintain its nickel pricing by the time 1955 rolled around. The company now had over 460,000 vending machines, which required maintenance and upgrades, though it still promoted itself as the “nickel Coke” brand, which helped embed Coke into American consumer culture alongside McDonald’s, Apple Pie, and Baseball. 10. 1959 Coca-Cola&#8217;s pricing would remain stable until 1959, when it finally increased. Unfortunately, the end of Coca-Cola’s famous nickel pricing came in 1959 when the company raised the price as high as $0.06. The single-cent increase has generally been attributed to rising inflation, which is unfortunate, considering the nickel price survived the Great Depression and two World Wars. There is no question this was the end of an era for the company, one of the most notable price updates in US industry history. 9. 1965 It&#8217;s hard to ignore the global recognition of the Coke brand. In 1965, the cost of a bottle of Coke was generally between 10 and 15 cents. Generally speaking, most people would pay on the lower end, around 10 cents, which was the most common price at Coke vending machines. At this point, the company was also expanding globally, with bottles sold in over 100 countries. 8. 1970 Coca-Cola was heavily reliant on vending machine sales for decades. With an approximate 25% jump in pricing between 1965 and 1970, Coke was now selling for around 15 cents per bottle. The 6.5-ounce bottle was still the company&#8217;s top seller, but there is no question that larger cans and bottles were gaining popularity with customers. At this point in history, Coke was expanding into more than 135 countries. 7. 1976 The launch of Diet Coke was a success, but it also led to increased pricing. By the time 1976 rolled out, the price of a Coke was approximately $0.20, which would be equivalent to $1.09 in 2024 dollars. Inflation was the primary driver of the price increase, resulting in a 2.56% annual price increase. However, Coke also sought to introduce new products around this time with the release of Diet Coke, aiming to diversify its portfolio better. Additionally, the 6.5-ounce bottle was being phased out in favor of 12-ounce cans. 6. 1985 The launch of &#8220;New Coke&#8221; was a failure, but it also led to increased pricing. In the mid-1980s, a 12-ounce bottle of Coca-Cola cost approximately $0.35, although most people purchased it in packs of six. Single cans could be a little pricier in vending machines, which remained one of the most popular ways to purchase a single bottle. Coke also launched “New Coke” around this period in 1985, which failed, and marketing costs had an indirect effect on pricing. 5. 1993 In 1993, Coke pricing was still heavily reliant on 12-ounce cans. Pricing for a 12-ounce can of Coca-Cola was around 50 cents in 1993, although a single 12-ounce can could cost as high as 75 cents, depending on the location. There was no question that at this point, Coke’s sales strategy was focused on 12-packs, which offered better value and allowed them to slightly lower costs to customers shopping in grocery stores. 4. 2000 The year 2000 was one of the last years when Coke was sold for under $1.00. For 75 cents at the turn of the century, you could grab yourself a bottle of 12-ounce Coke, unless you lived in places where it was selling for around $1.00. Grocery store 12-packs were still your best bet as you could get a 12-pack for around $4.00, which made the single-serve bottles far less costly overall. 3. 2010 You could enjoy Coca-Cola in 2010 for the price of $1.00 a bottle. Coming out of a period of economic uncertainty, Coke raised its pricing to around $1.00 in 2010. This meant that a 12-ounce can in a vending machine was generally priced between $1.00 and $1.25, depending on the seller. Coca-Cola raised prices following the Great Recession, which began in 2008. 2. 2020 Coca-Cola has turned to liter bottles as a big sales driver. Unsurprisingly, 2020 was a challenging year for Coke and other companies, as disruptions to its supply chain, resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic, affected pricing. This means that customers were now paying approximately $1.50 for a single bottle and as much as $7.00 in stores for a 12-pack. The company launched its “Recipe for Magic” campaign in 2021 to justify its price increases. 1. 2025 There&#8217;s just something special about a classic Coca-Cola bottle. In 2025, if you wanted to purchase a 2-liter Coca-Cola bottle, it would cost approximately $2.79, according to my local Target. Depending on where you live in the country, prices can vary between $2.00 and $2.69 for a 12-ounce can, with a 6-pack typically priced around $5.49, as seen at a local Target. If you look back at pricing since 1970, Coca-Cola&#8217;s pricing has increased approximately 5,280% for a 2L bottle since 1970.

Fortunately, Buffett has shared investment nuggets along the way from which investors can glean to build their own winning strategies, formulas that fit both their risk tolerance, financial goals and budget. While Buffett is known for investing in individual stocks, those whose business models are simple enough to understand, he is ultimately an investor who is in it for the long haul. Similarly, ETFs are designed to let investors ride the market wave without having to make frequent changes if they don&#8217;t want to. That is why we believe we&#8217;ve identified three ETFs that Buffett himself would approve of for the average investor in July. iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF) Considering Warren Buffett&#8217;s inaugural investment was famously in a bank—Cities Service preferred shares—and financial institutions remain a lighthouse for his investment decisions, it makes sense to begin our exploration here. Our first pick: the iShares U.S. Financials ETF (IYF). And with Buffett&#8217;s own Berkshire Hathaway counted among this ETF&#8217;s top holdings, it would likely appeal to the Oracle of Omaha. In addition to banks, IYF targets exposure to the insurance sector, playing into the hands of Buffett&#8217;s affinity for insurance, which he has called the &#8220;engine&#8221; that has powered Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s performance for decades. The IYF ETF boasts a lineup of colossal financial institutions like JPMorgan (NYSE: JPM), Bank of America (NYSE: BAC) and Wells Fargo (NYSE: WFC), offering investors access to stable banks renowned for their robust balance sheets. These titans of finance have a demonstrated history of navigating—and profiting through—evolving market cycles. This resilience can significantly benefit investors, especially when these institutions commit to enhancing shareholder value through activities like stock buybacks. Even in economic climates with elevated interest rates, banks often find an advantage, benefiting from higher loan rates for borrowers while simultaneously attracting savers with compelling yields. Investors have also been betting on the likelihood of lower interest rates, a phenomenon that could take hold as soon as July at the next Fed meeting. This optimism has benefited the iShares U.S. Financials ETF, sending the fund to revisit its 52-week high level of approximately $123 recently, offering investors an opportunity to potentially ride this wave in July. As of early July, the IYF ETF has delivered returns of 10.8%, nearly doubling the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s returns of 6.75% over the same stretch. Over the past year, this financials ETF boasts a total return of 19.5%, in line with its benchmark index, the Russell 1000 Financials 40 Act 15/22.5 Daily Capped Index (USD). With an expense ratio of 0.39%, investors won&#8217;t have to worry about having to overpay: If you invest $10,000 in IYF, you would pay approximately $39 in fees per year. Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD) Next up is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (SCHD). Not only does this ETF deliver consistent income, but one of its core components is yet another Warren Buffett favorite: Coca-Cola (NYSE: KO). The iconic beverage giant commands a 4.3% slice of the SCHD ETF, and remarkably, represents a whopping 9.7% of Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s total portfolio. Within the SCHD ETF, Coca-Cola is joined by fellow dividend stalwarts like Verizon Communications (NYSE: VZ), Altria Group (NYSE: MO) and Lockheed Martin (NYSE: LMT). These companies have built reputations for consistently returning value to shareholders through robust dividends, making them almost a guaranteed fit for Buffett&#8217;s investing playbook. Their predictable cash flows and essential products underpin a long history of rewarding shareholders, a characteristic central to Buffett&#8217;s philosophy. While Buffett&#8217;s company, Berkshire Hathaway, isn&#8217;t a dividend-paying stock itself, that certainly doesn&#8217;t mean he discounts their power. Buffett has openly championed dividend-paying stocks as a shrewd strategy for investors on the hunt for steady income. Perhaps the most convincing evidence lies in Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s top holding—Coca-Cola—a stock that diligently pays a dividend, which Buffett has no intentions of selling anytime soon. Its global brand power and consistent profitability make it a perpetual cash cow for Berkshire&#8217;s coffers. In early 2025, Coca-Cola announced its 63rd straight annual dividend hike, lifting its quarterly payout by 5.2% to $0.51 per share. Considering Buffett owns approximately 400 million shares of Coca-Cola stock, his company is effectively raking in over $800 million each year in dividend checks. Coca-Cola stock is also up 14.5% year-to-date, offering investors the added bonus of capital appreciation alongside their income. As for the broader Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF, it meticulously tracks the total return of the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index. With an incredibly modest expense ratio of just 0.060%, the SCHD ETF boasts over 100 holdings, granting shareholders a strong degree of diversification for protection. The fund’s underlying strategy prioritizes quality over quantity, avoiding risky high-yielding dividend stocks. Instead, it favors companies with long, proven track records of reliable payouts, offering investors a more reliable income stream and reduced volatility. This disciplined approach means even when the fund&#8217;s overall value experiences a dip, as it appears to have done in this wild 2025, investors still receive the benefit of earning consistent income through dividend distributions—which, Buffett seems to agree, is the ultimate icing on the cake for dividend stock investors anyway. Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) The Invesco QQQ Trust (QQQ) is a popular ETF known for its exposure to some high-flying technology stocks, including Apple (Nasdaq: AAPL) and Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN). In fact, most of its top-10 holdings are technology stocks, with the exception of Costco Wholesale (Nasdaq: COST). While Warren Buffett isn&#8217;t known for his technology prowess, favoring instead businesses with more simple models, he has warmed up to the technology sector in recent years. Today, Apple and Amazon comprise 21.7% and 0.8% of Berkshire Hathaway&#8217;s portfolio, respectively. Apple is one of only a handful of Buffett&#8217;s technology stocks, which he began adding nearly a decade ago. The billionaire investor dove in head first with a $1 billion investment, making the iPhone maker one of the top holdings of Berkshire&#8217;s portfolio. Today Apple remains a key holding, with Berkshire&#8217;s investment worth over $64 billion. Buffett also bemoaned his hesitancy to add Amazon stock sooner than he did, kicking himself for for being &#8220;too dumb.&#8221; But he won&#8217;t make that mistake twice, and his AMZN holdings are now worth $2.2 billion in the Berkshire portfolio. Given their high-growth nature, the companies that make up the QQQ ETF are heavy capex spenders. While this strategy comes with an inherent amount of risk, which is the first group to be punished in challenging economic environments, the payoff can be equally as rewarding. And when it comes to capital appreciation, QQQ doesn&#8217;t disappoint. The QQQ ETF has delivered impressive long-term returns, outshining the S&amp;P 500 in seven out of the past 10 years. Investors who directed $10,000 invested in Invesco QQQ in 2020 would have seen their investment balloon to approximately $22,976 today. So far in 2025, QQQ posted a strong year-to-date gain of approximately 8%; at this pace, it will replicate last year&#8217;s returns of approximately 16%. Investors also receive a rather efficient expense ratio of just 0.20%, making it a cost-effective investment vehicle for access to Big Tech stocks, among other sector leaders. Investors with an appetite for risk and growth might find the QQQ appealing while also seizing the opportunity to hold a couple of Warren Buffett favorites.The post Here Are 3 ETFs Warren Buffett Would Approve Of for the Average Investor appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/07/07/here-are-3-etfs-warren-buffett-would-approve-of-for-the-average-investor-2/

You can use low-fee dividend-paying ETFs to help keep your costs low. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) If you&#8217;ve saved up $10,000 to invest in dividend stocks, congratulations. You&#8217;re ready to embark on a potentially profitable journey that will reward patience and prudence with time-tested wealth-building opportunities. Among the most important guidelines for a $10,000 dividend portfolio is to keep your costs down. Otherwise, your profits could turn into losses over the long run. The good news is that there are ways to save money, time, and effort with specific dividend portfolio building strategies. You&#8217;ll be amazed to discover how far you can stretch a $10,000 investment account if you proceed with prudence and due diligence. No Need to Pick Stocks There was a time, not too long ago, when high fees made picking individual stocks an expensive proposition. If you had a $10,000 investment account, the fees/commissions for buying and selling stocks could have noticeably reduced your portfolio&#8217;s value. Nowadays, however, the fees/commissions for buying and selling stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs) are typically very low or even nonexistent. This raises two significant points. First, you&#8217;ll want to choose a reputable low-cost broker if you have $10,000 to invest. The second point is that you may be tempted to buy hundreds of individual stocks because the high-fee barrier has been eliminated. Yet, it&#8217;s not necessarily a great idea to embark on a dividend stock picking journey. Bear in mind that stock picking involves time and research. Besides, you might not have the expertise or the confidence to successfully build your $10,000 portfolio with individual dividend stocks. A simple solution is to select a handful of dividend ETFs so you won&#8217;t have to do any stock picking. Just make sure that they&#8217;re low-fee ETFs that hold a variety of well-known dividend-paying stocks. High Quality Without High Costs If you have $10,000 to invest, you could go through the trouble of selecting 100 or more dividend stocks for a fully diversified portfolio. Or, you could just put $2,500 into four ETFs, or instead put $2,000 into five ETFs. To make it easier for you, I&#8217;ll point out a half-dozen diversified dividend-paying ETFs with annual operating fees below 1%. These are the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD), the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI), the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ), the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI), the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI), and the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO). You can go here to read my overview of QQQI, JEPQ, SCHD, DIVO, and SPYI. Then, you can go here to get my summary of JEPI. For now, here&#8217;s a bullet-point recap of this six-pack of diversified dividend-stock ETFs: SCHD: Focuses on the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index; includes around 100 large-cap stocks; annual distribution (dividend) yield of 3.97%; annual operating fees (automatically deducted from the ETF&#8217;s share price) of 0.06% JEPI: Focuses on carefully selected S&amp;P 500 members; includes 122 stocks; annual yield of 8.25%; annual operating fees of 0.35% JEPQ: Focuses on the technology-heavy NASDAQ 100 index; includes 108 stocks; annual yield of 11.52%; annual operating fees of 0.35% QQQI: Focuses on the NASDAQ 100 stock index; includes approximately 100 stocks; annual yield of 14.65%; annual operating fees of 0.68% SPYI: Focuses on constituents of the S&amp;P 500; includes roughly 500 stocks; annual yield of 12.15%; annual operating fees of 0.68% DIVO: Focuses on large-cap dividend and earnings growers; includes 25 stocks; annual yield of 4.73%; annual operating fees of 0.56% These ETFs typically include established blue-chip stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD). Feel free to investigate the six low-fee ETFs I mentioned above along with other dividend-paying funds that meet your criteria. Strong Performance Doesn&#8217;t Have to Be Expensive So far, we&#8217;ve looked for ETFs featuring high-quality large-cap stock holdings, good diversification, and low annual operating fees. Plus, these funds usually cost less than $100 per share, so they should easily fit into a $10,000 portfolio. The final piece of the puzzle is to make sure that you&#8217;re picking ETFs that not only pay dividends, but also have share prices that increase over time. Otherwise, you could end up losing money overall even if you&#8217;re collecting dividend payments. To provide an example, you&#8217;ll notice that the SCHD ETF&#8217;s share price has increased dramatically over the years, and these gains don&#8217;t even include the dividend payments: Another example is the JEPI ETF, which has had its ups and downs but has still delivered substantial share-price gains (not including dividends): By making equal-sized contributions to four, five, or even six dividend ETFs, you could aim for both share-price growth and consistent dividends. With the right plan in place, you can maximize the profit potential of your $10,000 dividend portfolio while keeping your costs to an absolute minimum.The post How to Build a Super Low-Cost Dividend Portfolio for $10,000 appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/07/08/how-to-build-a-super-low-cost-dividend-portfolio-for-10000/

Add in a few low-cost, risk-reduced ETFs for enhanced diversification. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Investing in the 2020s isn&#8217;t exclusively for the wealthy. With as little as $5,000, you can build a low-cost portfolio with excellent growth potential for the long term. Selecting a handful of affordable stocks and low-priced exchange traded funds (ETFs) will allow you to diversify and thereby de-risk your portfolio. As we&#8217;ll see, a few simple strategies can help you turn your $5,000 into a worry-free passive income generator. Finding Affordable, Low-Risk Stocks To properly diversify your $5,000 portfolio, you&#8217;ll want to select some ETFs with baskets of stocks. However, it&#8217;s fine to start off by picking a few individual stocks. You&#8217;ll want to concentrate on large-cap blue-chip stocks representing well-known brands with good reputations. That&#8217;s the first key to de-risking your portfolio. Furthermore, you&#8217;ll need to narrow down your picks to low-priced stocks. Also, you&#8217;ll want to focus on stocks with low beta. To sum it up, beta is a measure of how fast a stock moves (in both directions, up and down) when compared to the S&amp;P 500 large-cap stock index. The S&amp;P 500 has a beta of exactly 1. If a stock has a beta of less than 1, then its price tends to move slower than the S&amp;P 500. That&#8217;s a sign that the stock has low volatility and is relatively safe. 3 Low-Priced Stocks to Get You Started The best way to explain my stock picking process for a $5,000 portfolio is with a few examples. One candidate is AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) stock, which represents a famous, well-established, and highly profitable company. As of July 9, 2025, AT&amp;T stock cost less than $30 per share. Plus, the stock had a beta (based on the past five years&#8217; worth of price action) of 0.6. That beta is much lower than 1, so AT&amp;T stock tends to move substantially slower than the S&amp;P 500. Moreover, the stock offers a forward annual dividend yield of 3.84%, which is a nice bonus for the shareholders. Another example is Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock. There&#8217;s no doubt that you&#8217;ve heard of this company, and it&#8217;s been a profitable dividend payer for many years. Coca-Cola stock checks all the right boxes for a $5,000 low-risk portfolio. The stock costs around $70 per share (I&#8217;m looking for stocks below $100), has an ultra-low beta of 0.46, and offers a 2.88% annual dividend yield. Then there&#8217;s pharmaceutical giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), which provides its loyal investors with a massive 7.1% annual dividend yield. Given Pfizer stock&#8217;s low share price of around $25 and its beta of 0.49, this certainly looks like a strong candidate for a low-risk $5,000 investment account. De-Risk and Diversify With ETFs Even if you pick a dozen stocks for your $5,000 portfolio, that&#8217;s still not enough diversification. Therefore, you can add a few ETFs representing baskets of stocks. If they pay decent dividends, you could further enhance your profit potential. My favorite ETF pick is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This fund focuses on the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index and includes roughly 100 large-cap stocks. With an annual distribution (dividend) yield of 3.97%, the SCHD ETF will deposit cash into your $5,000 account every three months. It will also generally mitigate share-price volatility as the fund has a beta of 0.78. Next, I will refer you to Joey Frenette&#8217;s excellent article about two ETF&#8217;s under $50 which also happen to be low-risk. The first one is the Invesco S&amp;P SmallCap Low Volatility ETF (NYSEARCA:XSLV), which has a share price below $50. Small-cap stocks can be volatile when purchased individually. However, the XSLV ETF includes hundreds of high-confidence small-cap stocks across multiple market sectors. Besides, you&#8217;ll get access to consistent dividends as XSLV has a 12-month distribution rate of 2.43%. On top of all that, the fund&#8217;s beta of 0.82 is reasonably low, which means you can sleep soundly at night if you own the Invesco S&amp;P SmallCap Low Volatility ETF. Frenette also highlights the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (NYSEARCA:SPHD), which trades for slightly less than $50 per share. SPHD&#8217;s 12-month distribution rate of 3.41% is quite respectable, and the fund provides exposure to around 50 stocks from the prestigious S&amp;P 500 index. With a quick check, we can see that the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF has a fairly low beta of 0.77. By combining XSLV and SPHD, investors can achieve a balanced mix of small-caps and large-caps. Along with that, you could purchase shares of the SCHD ETF and a small selection of affordable, low-beta individual stocks. When all is said and done, your $5,000 can get you a risk-reduced low-cost portfolio to hold for many years.The post How to Build a Low-Cost Portfolio for $5,000 Without Taking Risks appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/07/10/how-to-build-a-low-cost-portfolio-for-5000-without-taking-risks/

Meanwhile, SPYI and DIVO can help monthly payout seekers diversify beyond the tech sector. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) It wasn&#8217;t very long ago that passive income investors had to wait three full months before an exchange traded fund (ETF) would finally pay a dividend. Recently, however, an explosion in the number of ETFs has enabled more frequent cash distributions and powerful wealth-compounding possibilities. Five funds in particular are changing the ETF game with eye-catching yields and monthly cash payouts. Ambitious dividend harvesters can try out some of these funds or even, if they dare, buy all five of the following passive income ETF all-stars. MSTY, QQQI, and JEPQ for Tech Exposure All five of the ETFs featured today provide cash dividends/distributions each and every month. Yet, there are crucial differences between these funds, especially when it comes to their annual yields and risk profiles. To start off, I&#8217;ll direct your attention to an ETF that&#8217;s on the hotter end of the risk spectrum. I&#8217;m referring to the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSTY), which generates some income from U.S. Treasury bonds but mainly relies on option-trading strategies. More specifically, the MSTY ETF uses synthetic covered call strategies (or possibly synthetic covered call spread strategies) to indirectly derive income from Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock. As you may be aware, Microstrategy is a technology firm that aggressively invests in Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC). Since Microstrategy stock can be quite volatile and option-trading strategies can be risky, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF isn&#8217;t for the faint of heart. On the other hand, high risks can come with huge rewards as the MSTY ETF currently advertises a gigantic 72.93% annual distribution rate. While MSTY pays you every month and has an enormous annual yield, it&#8217;s not everybody&#8217;s cup of tea. Maybe you still want exposure to interesting technology companies but aren&#8217;t prepared to accept high risk. If so, then I&#8217;ve got two monthly-paying funds that emphasize the tech sector but aren&#8217;t overly volatile. The first one is the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI), which is centered around the tech-heavy NASDAQ 100 stock index. This fund uses options-trading strategies to squeeze income from a basket of approximately 100 stocks, including NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). The NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF is reshaping portfolios by eliminating the need to pick individual tech stocks while also providing monthly income. In addition, QQQI&#8217;s 14.65% annual distribution rate will undoubtedly make it attractive to yield hunters. In a similar vein to QQQI, the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ) focuses on stocks in the NASDAQ 100. This fund collects income from 108 stocks that are mainly in the technology sector, and like MSTY and QQQI, the JEPQ ETF utilizes options-trading strategies. Thus, it shouldn&#8217;t be too surprising that the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF enables portfolio exposure to technology titans like NVIDIA, Apple, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Amazon, Broadcom, and Netflix (NASDAQ:NFLX). With a 12-month rolling dividend yield of 11.52%, the JEPQ ETF should impress any passive income enthusiast yearning for monthly wealth-building opportunities. SPYI and DIVO for Multi-Sector Diversification There&#8217;s no denying that audacious ETFs like MSTY, QQQI, and JEPQ are taking passive income investing to the next level. But then, you might prefer funds that venture beyond the technology sector while still paying out distributions each month. On that topic, I&#8217;ve got a pair of potent funds offering instant multi-sector diversification. One of them is the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI). Instead of sticking to the NASDAQ 100, the SPYI ETF concentrates on the S&amp;P 500 and has around 500 stocks in its holdings. This fund can quickly diversify your portfolio across a wide variety of stocks and sectors. Within the SPYI ETF, you&#8217;ll see large-cap standouts like Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), and Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY). Like the other funds on this list, the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF relies on options-trading strategies to produce income. After you discover that SPYI features monthly cash payouts and a 12.15% annual distribution rate, you may find it hard to resist taking a share position. Rounding out this five-pack of passive income boundary breakers is the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO), which derives income from dividends and options-trading strategies based on 24 stocks. Those 24 stocks aren&#8217;t all tech stocks, mind you. Sure, you&#8217;ll find Microsoft stock in the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF&#8217;s holdings. However, you&#8217;ll also find non-tech-focused firms like Home Depot, Visa (NYSE:V), RTX/Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), and Goldman Sachs (NYSE:GS). Maybe DIVO&#8217;s 4.73% annual distribution rate isn&#8217;t as mind-blowing as the other funds I&#8217;m highlighting today. Nevertheless, the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF&#8217;s diversified basket features some rock-solid companies and the fund&#8217;s monthly payouts will add up over the long run. As you can see, there are similarities but also important distinctions between MSTY, QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, and DIVO. All five of these ETFs are altering the landscape of passive income investing so, if you&#8217;re ready, feel free to try them out today.The post These 5 ETFs (MSTY, QQQI, JEPQ, SPYI, DIVO) Are Reshaping Passive Income Portfolios appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/07/14/these-5-etfs-msty-qqqi-jepq-spyi-divo-are-reshaping-passive-income-portfolios/

To boost your monthly income potential, try a few high-yield funds that focus on single stocks (APLY, GOOY, AMZY, NVDY). It’s hard to believe, but today there are credit cards offering up to 6% cash back, $200 statement credits, $0 annual fees, travel rewards, and more. See for yourself, I couldn’t believe it at first. Frankly, with rewards this good we don’t expect them to be available forever. But if you sign up today you can secure some of the best rewards we’ve ever seen. Click here to get started. Retirement is almost here? No need to fear! Even if your monthly goal of earning $5,000 in dividends starts in just three months, it&#8217;s possible to achieve this by carefully investing in high-yield exchange traded funds (ETFs). To get dividends/distributions totaling $5,000 per month or $60,000 per year, you can use a combination of diversified income-producing ETFs and single-stock-focused funds. Assuming you&#8217;ll have saved up $500,000 for retirement three years from now, you will need to achieve a 12% average annual yield to get $60,000 worth of income per year. The plan is to allocate 80% of your investable capital toward a pair a diversified ETFs that offer annual yields of around 12% to 15%. Then, to put you decisively above the $5,000-per-month threshold, you could invest the remaining 20% of your retirement funds in a few ETFs that derive high yields from single stocks. So, let&#8217;s dive right in and see how this powerful plan works. 2 Diversified ETFs With High Yields The first part of the plan is to devote 80% of your investable retirement savings toward two diversified ETFs. More specifically you can allocate 40% of your capital toward the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI) and other 40% toward the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI). To earn passive income of $5,000 per month when you retire in three years, you&#8217;ll need to achieve at least 12% average annual yield on a $500,000 investment. The NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF exceeds the 12% objective with an annual distribution rate of 14.65%. You&#8217;ll end up paying annualized operating fees of 0.68%, but even after subtracting that, QQQI&#8217;s yield would still be above 12%. There&#8217;s still the question of whether this is safe yield, though. I would assess the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF as reasonably safe because this diversified fund invests in approximately 100 well-known technology firms. Based on the NASDAQ 100 index, the QQQI ETF&#8217;s holdings include tech leaders like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO), and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META). Furthermore, the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF pays out its cash distributions each and every month. Consequently, you may be able to take advantage of the compounding effect by reinvesting the distributions. For even more diversification, you can match your QQQI allocation with an equal-sized investment in the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF. Centered around the prestigious S&amp;P 500 large-cap stock index, the SPYI ETF includes around 500 stocks in its list of holdings. You&#8217;ll probably recognize many of the names on that holdings list, such as Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Bank of America (NYSE:BAC), Occidental Petroleum (NYSE:OXY), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Since the fund includes so many famous names across multiple market sectors, you can invest in the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF with confidence. Like QQQI, the SPYI ETF pays its distributions on a monthly basis, so that&#8217;s a nice benefit. Will the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF achieve a 12% yield, though? The fund currently advertises an annual distribution rate of 12.15%, but you&#8217;ll have to pay operating fees totaling 0.68%. Remember, though, that you can invest equally in the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF and the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF. That way, you should average 12% yield or more (assuming there are no distribution cuts) with 80% of your portfolio. Boost Your Yield With Single-Stock Funds Just to make sure that you&#8217;ll achieve at least $5,000 of monthly passive income, you can dedicate the remaining 20% of your portfolio toward a handful of single-stock funds. These ETFs are riskier because they&#8217;re not diversified, but their annual yields are quite impressive. I&#8217;m referring to four ETFs which all pay their distributions on a monthly basis. You can go here for detailed explanation of the four funds, but I&#8217;ll provide a quick summary right now. The YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:APLY) indirectly derives income from Apple stock. It advertises an annual distribution rate of 26.97% but you&#8217;ll have to deduct operating expenses of 1.06%. That still leaves you with an expected net yield of 26.97% &#8211; 1.06%, or 25.91%, which is nothing to sneeze at. Here are three similar ETFs to consider: The YieldMax GOOGL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:GOOY); based on the stock of Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL); annual distribution rate of 33.14% &#8211; 1.2% worth of operating expenses = expected net yield of 31.94%. The YieldMax AMZN Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMZY); based on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock; annual distribution rate of 47.52% &#8211; 1.17% worth of operating expenses = expected net yield of 46.35%. The YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:NVDY); based on NVIDIA stock; annual distribution rate of 50.19% &#8211; 1.27% worth of operating expenses = expected net yield of 48.92%. Balancing Safety and Risk Since they involve more risk, you wouldn&#8217;t want to invest too much of your retirement money in APLY, GOOY, AMZY, and NVDY. However, it&#8217;s not excessive to allocate 5% toward each ETF for a total of 20%. After all, these are four gigantic technology firms and the huge yields will quickly boost your portfolio&#8217;s total yield above 12%. Besides, 80% of your investment account would be invested in the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF and the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF, which are safer because they&#8217;re more diversified. If you get started today, you can use these ETFs to build a safety-and-risk-balanced retirement portfolio generating $5,000 per month or more.The post Retiring in 3 Years and Need $5,000/Month—Here’s the Portfolio to Build Now appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/07/16/retiring-in-3-years-and-need-5000-month-heres-the-portfolio-to-build-now/

KO,2025-07-18 12:17:18,High-fructose corn syrup vs. cane sugar in foods: The cost of switching ingredients,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/highfructose-corn-syrup-vs-cane-sugar-in-foods-the-20250718.jpg,https://www.foxbusiness.com,"Replacing high-fructose corn syrup with cane sugar could come at a cost, according to industry experts. Bulk high-fructose corn syrup cost about $0.35 per pound for 2025, only rising from $0.27 in 2015, and remaining fairly close to this price in the past few years, according to data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA).  In comparison, the price of refined white sugar is $1.01, which is up substantially from $0.61 in 2015. On Wednesday, President Donald Trump relayed that Coca-Cola agreed to use ""real"" cane sugar in Coke sold in the United States. ""I have been speaking to Coca-Cola about using REAL Cane Sugar in Coke in the United States, and they have agreed to do so,"" Trump wrote on Truth Social. ""I’d like to thank all of those in authority at Coca-Cola. This will be a very good move by them — You’ll see. It’s just better!"" Coca-Cola has not confirmed whether it is making this switch. FOX Business reached out to Coca-Cola for comment. In the 1980s, the beverage giant swapped cane sugar, which came with high tariffs, for high-fructose corn syrup. High-fructose corn syrup was the cheaper alternative due to corn farming subsidies. Despite such praise, experts say there are financial consequences of the switch to cane sugar for the consumer as well as farmers. TRUMP SUCCESSFULLY CONVINCES COCA-COLA TO BRING BACK 'REAL' CANE SUGAR IN US DRINKS: 'IT’S JUST BETTER!' The main issue, according to Bryan Le, a food scientist and principal food consultant at Mendocino Food Consulting, is that there is significantly more corn available in the U.S. compared to cane sugar. Corn represents the No. 1 crop produced in the U.S., with the vast majority of states producing it. This means it the 850 billion pounds of corn produced each year can easily and cheaply be converted to corn syrup, Le said. Meanwhile, three states – Texas, Florida and Louisiana – produce 8 billion pounds of cane sugar each year. The remaining sources of cane sugar are from Mexico, which is facing tariffs. GENERAL MILLS LATEST US FOOD GIANT PULLING ARTIFICIAL DYES FROM PRODUCTS Another issue that drives up the cost of cane sugar is that the ingredient ""requires more extensive processing and energy to crystallize, filter and transform it into a white product,"" according to Le. ""It is much less complex of a process to produce high-fructose corn syrup from many of the possible low-cost inputs available from the corn industry,"" he added. Meanwhile, the Corn Refiners Association (CRA), argued that there would be severe economic implications if the industry eliminated high-fructose corn syrup, which the group says has been ""a foundational ingredient in the U.S. food supply for nearly half a century."" The association said that if high-fructose corn syrup was completely eliminated it would slash corn prices by up to $0.34 per bushel, wiping out $5.1 billion in revenue to farms. ""The resulting economic shockwave would lead to rural job losses and significant economic consequences to communities across the country,"" the association wrote in a July report. GET FOX BUSINESS ON THE GO BY CLICKING HERE The corn refining demand loss from HFCS, glucose, dextrose and starch could result in short-term losses of $13.9 billion, with losses eventually reaching between $5.2 billion and $7.5 billion annually, according to the group, which highlighted that this would hurt local economies, ""especially in regions anchored by corn refineries, where farmers stand to lose $0.25 to $0.50 per bushel in price premiums alone."" While it remains to be seen what Coca-Cola will do, Arun Sundaram, senior equity analyst at CFRA Research, told FOX Business that it's more likely that the company would launch a new product line featuring cane sugar in place of corn syrup, rather than pulling its core lineup, which uses corn syrup, from shelves. ""A cane sugar variant would likely carry a premium price, given the higher cost of natural ingredients. Matching current price points would require a significant increase in U.S. production or imports of cane sugar, a scenario that seems unlikely in the near term, especially with existing tariffs on key exporters like Brazil,"" he said.",https://www.foxbusiness.com/lifestyle/high-fructose-corn-syrup-vs-cane-sugar-foods-cost-switching-ingredients

Key Points The President of the United States attended one of the nation’s most prestigious universities. The president isn’t the only famous graduate to have attended this school.

Indeed, you don&#8217;t need to be a wizard at stock-picking to do well and grow your wealth over the years. All it takes is patience and a solid game plan to transform an inheritance into a retirement portfolio that generates a good amount of passive income for life. Undoubtedly, going down the dividend route (which sees investors pursue higher yields) isn&#8217;t all too bad an idea. But for someone who&#8217;s new to investing, it can be pretty easy to be carried away as one chases yield across various corners of the stock market. With half a million to invest, it&#8217;s probably best not to veer too far off course by loading up on the yields well above 7-8% without a rock-solid foundation to build upon (think a diversified dividend-focused ETF). Key Points Investing one’s $500k windfall is a smart idea, regardless of the market’s mood at any given time. For a dividend investor, starting with a higher-yield ETF like the SCHD and SPYD is a great way to start. Afterward, individual names can be added to the mix. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Dividend investing is smart, but don&#8217;t forget about appreciation. Though covered call ETFs can provide safer, beefier yields, it&#8217;s their &#8220;total returns&#8221; that income investors should keep track of. In a prior piece, I highlighted the dangers of chasing yield and not keeping tabs on capital appreciation and total returns. At the end of the day, a young person needs not only a decent dividend yield but a good amount of growth to pick up the pace on the road to a comfortable retirement. For instance, it&#8217;s far better to have a 4% yield alongside a 12% capital gain (16% total return) in any given year than an 8% yield and zero to show on the front of capital gains (that&#8217;d result in just an 8% total return). Additionally, diversification is key for new investors, allowing them to stay afloat when the next big industry correction hits. For someone who&#8217;s looking to put such a large six-figure amount to work, it&#8217;s easy to be a bit jittery now that valuations are high and tariff threats remain. And though it&#8217;s tempting to wait for the next big market pullback, timing your entry to the market could put you at risk of missing out on further gains. At the end of the day, it&#8217;s impossible to tell what&#8217;s up next for markets over the short term. Over the long term, though, the odds are on the side of stocks. Forming a foundation with low-cost index ETFs is a smart way to go. Personally, I&#8217;d suggest bringing on a financial advisor and setting the bedrock (or foundation) of one&#8217;s portfolio around an S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index ETF. For those looking for more of a growth jolt, a Nasdaq 100 ETF or an international and emerging markets ETF may be added to the mix. Just as you wouldn&#8217;t build a house on unstable ground, you shouldn&#8217;t start a six-figure portfolio without a rock-solid foundation. For a dividend-focused investor, however, the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD) or SPDR Portfolio S&amp;P 500 High Dividend ETF (NYSEARCA:SPYD) are great foundation plays, with their more-than-4% yields and history of capital appreciation. Those looking for more of a yield boost may wish to consider adding individual names to the portfolio that may be oversold at any given instance. A name like Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), which yields over 7%, looks like a nice complement to the SCHD or some S&amp;P 500 or total stock market index ETF. As always, though, do understand a company, its growth narrative, and the troubles it has and may continue to face over the foreseeable future. In any case, a market newcomer may wish to consult a financial advisor to figure out how much to put in stocks, bonds, cash, and even precious metals. Also, they can green light any ETFs or individual names you&#8217;ve already researched.

However, it&#8217;s fine to start off by picking a few individual stocks. You&#8217;ll want to concentrate on large-cap blue-chip stocks representing well-known brands with good reputations. That&#8217;s the first key to de-risking your portfolio. Furthermore, you&#8217;ll need to narrow down your picks to low-priced stocks. Also, you&#8217;ll want to focus on stocks with low beta. To sum it up, beta is a measure of how fast a stock moves (in both directions, up and down) when compared to the S&amp;P 500 large-cap stock index. The S&amp;P 500 has a beta of exactly 1. If a stock has a beta of less than 1, then its price tends to move slower than the S&amp;P 500. That&#8217;s a sign that the stock has low volatility and is relatively safe. 3 Low-Priced Stocks to Get You Started The best way to explain my stock picking process for a $5,000 portfolio is with a few examples. One candidate is AT&amp;T (NYSE:T) stock, which represents a famous, well-established, and highly profitable company. As of July 9, 2025, AT&amp;T stock cost less than $30 per share. Plus, the stock had a beta (based on the past five years&#8217; worth of price action) of 0.6. That beta is much lower than 1, so AT&amp;T stock tends to move substantially slower than the S&amp;P 500. Moreover, the stock offers a forward annual dividend yield of 3.84%, which is a nice bonus for the shareholders. Another example is Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO) stock. There&#8217;s no doubt that you&#8217;ve heard of this company, and it&#8217;s been a profitable dividend payer for many years. Coca-Cola stock checks all the right boxes for a $5,000 low-risk portfolio. The stock costs around $70 per share (I&#8217;m looking for stocks below $100), has an ultra-low beta of 0.46, and offers a 2.88% annual dividend yield. Then there&#8217;s pharmaceutical giant Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), which provides its loyal investors with a massive 7.1% annual dividend yield. Given Pfizer stock&#8217;s low share price of around $25 and its beta of 0.49, this certainly looks like a strong candidate for a low-risk $5,000 investment account. De-Risk and Diversify With ETFs Even if you pick a dozen stocks for your $5,000 portfolio, that&#8217;s still not enough diversification. Therefore, you can add a few ETFs representing baskets of stocks. If they pay decent dividends, you could further enhance your profit potential. My favorite ETF pick is the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD). This fund focuses on the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index and includes roughly 100 large-cap stocks. With an annual distribution (dividend) yield of 3.97%, the SCHD ETF will deposit cash into your $5,000 account every three months. It will also generally mitigate share-price volatility as the fund has a beta of 0.78. Next, I will refer you to Joey Frenette&#8217;s excellent article about two ETF&#8217;s under $50 which also happen to be low-risk. The first one is the Invesco S&amp;P SmallCap Low Volatility ETF (NYSEARCA:XSLV), which has a share price below $50. Small-cap stocks can be volatile when purchased individually. However, the XSLV ETF includes hundreds of high-confidence small-cap stocks across multiple market sectors. Besides, you&#8217;ll get access to consistent dividends as XSLV has a 12-month distribution rate of 2.43%. On top of all that, the fund&#8217;s beta of 0.82 is reasonably low, which means you can sleep soundly at night if you own the Invesco S&amp;P SmallCap Low Volatility ETF. Frenette also highlights the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (NYSEARCA:SPHD), which trades for slightly less than $50 per share. SPHD&#8217;s 12-month distribution rate of 3.41% is quite respectable, and the fund provides exposure to around 50 stocks from the prestigious S&amp;P 500 index. With a quick check, we can see that the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF has a fairly low beta of 0.77. By combining XSLV and SPHD, investors can achieve a balanced mix of small-caps and large-caps. Along with that, you could purchase shares of the SCHD ETF and a small selection of affordable, low-beta individual stocks. When all is said and done, your $5,000 can get you a risk-reduced low-cost portfolio to hold for many years.The post How to Build a Low-Cost Portfolio for $5,000 Without Taking Risks appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/07/10/how-to-build-a-low-cost-portfolio-for-5000-without-taking-risks/

Here’s the Smartest Way to Turn It Into Monthly Passive Income",https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/inherited-400000-heres-the-smartest-way-to-turn-it-20250717.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Key Points The SPHD and DIVO ETFs are ideal vehicles for volatility mitigation and reliable income. Furthermore, you can enhance your monthly income potential with single-stock ETFs. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) If you&#8217;re fortunate enough to inherit $400,000, it may be tempting to spend that money on cars and vacations. However, the smart-money move is to invest the funds wisely and plan for your financial future. One approach is to invest that $400,000 in exchange traded funds (ETFs) that provide passive income every month. That way, you can reinvest the cash distributions and take advantage of the compounding effect. So now, it&#8217;s time to reveal four funds that unlock monthly income opportunities so you can turn your inheritance into a cash-producing machine. SPHD: A Reliable Pick for Low Volatility $400,000 is a whole lot of money to inherit and invest. Therefore, your first priority shouldn&#8217;t be maximizing your monthly dividends. Instead, it should be mitigating your risk so you don&#8217;t lose all of that money. When safety and reliability are your top priorities, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF (NYSEARCA:SPHD) is a solid pick. This fund has 52 stocks in its holdings, all carefully selected from the S&amp;P 500 large-cap stock index. The SPHD ETF specifically chooses stocks &#8220;that historically have provided high dividend yields and low volatility.&#8221; Examples include Pfizer (NYSE:PFE), Realty Income Corp. (NYSE:O), Verizon Communications (NYSE:VZ), and Altria Group (NYSE:MO). These companies are known for providing consistent dividend payments, and their stocks typically aren&#8217;t volatile. Furthermore, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF features a 12-month distribution rate (i.e., a forward annual dividend yield) of 3.44%. Plus, the SPHD ETF pays out its distributions on a monthly basis. With all of that in mind, you could take $150,000 of your inherited $400,000, put it into the Invesco S&amp;P 500 High Dividend Low Volatility ETF, and sleep soundly at night. Stay in the Safe Lane With DIVO With $400,000 to invest, you&#8217;ll have a large account and there&#8217;s no need to drive in the fast lane. Instead, you can stay in the &#8220;safe lane&#8221; but still get a passive income stream with the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO). Much like the SPHD ETF, the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF seeks to reduce share-price volatility while providing exposure to high-quality dividend-paying companies. Moreover, like the other funds mentioned today, DIVO puts cash distributions into your account on a monthly basis. The Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF has 24 stocks in its holdings, and you&#8217;ll see plenty of large-cap sector leaders in there. Among the top holdings in the DIVO ETF are Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), RTX/Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX), Caterpillar (NYSE:CAT), Visa (NYSE:V), and Home Depot (NYSE:HD). Again, we&#8217;re choosing safety first and then aiming for good yield. Since the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF invests in great companies and features an impressive 4.73% annual distribution rate, it checks all the right boxes. Thus, it would make sense to allocate $150,000 of a $400,000 inheritance toward the DIVO ETF. Accelerate Your Yield With Single-Stock ETFs It&#8217;s wise to dedicate $300,000 of your $400,000 inheritance toward diversified low-volatility funds like SPHD and DIVO. If you do that, then you can invest the remaining $100,000 in ETFs with greater risk but also higher yields. To that end, YieldMax offers a wide variety of ETFs that each focus on a single stock instead of a diversified basket of stocks. Typically, these YieldMax ETFs derive monthly income from U.S. Treasury bonds and sophisticated options-trading strategies. One way to reduce the risk is to stick to YieldMax ETFs that focus on established large-cap companies. For example, the YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:APLY) indirectly derives income from Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) stock. Currently, the APLY ETF advertises an annual distribution rate of 26.99%. This fund shouldn&#8217;t be excessively risky as Apple is a reliable blue-chip business with staying power. So, you could invest $25,000 of your $400,000 inheritance in the YieldMax AAPL Option Income Strategy ETF. A reasonable plan would be to pick four single-stock ETFs with a focus on high-confidence companies. Then, you could allocate $25,000 toward each of the four funds you picked. A Mixed-Risk Approach APLY is just one example of many monthly-paying single-stock ETFs you can choose from. Here&#8217;s a summary of other funds in this category, and while you explore them, you might think about picking your four favorites: The YieldMax AMZN Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMZY); based on Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN) stock; 47.82% annual distribution rate The YieldMax NVDA Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:NVDY); based on NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) stock; 74.99% annual distribution rate The YieldMax GOOGL Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:GOOY); based on the stock of Google parent company Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOGL); 32.9% annual distribution rate The YieldMax MSFT Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSFO); based on Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) stock; 34.9% annual distribution rate The YieldMax JPM Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:JPMO); based on JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) stock; 39% annual distribution rate The YieldMax AMD Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:AMDY); based on Advanced Micro Devices (NASDAQ:AMD) stock; 68.07% annual distribution rate The YieldMax DIS Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:DISO); based on Walt Disney (NYSE:DIS) stock; 38.55% annual distribution rate The YieldMax XOM Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:XOMO); based on Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM) stock; 38.04% annual distribution rate Just to provide an idea of what your overall plan might look like, you could invest $150,000 in SPHD, $150,000 in DIVO, and $25,000 each in APLY, MSFO, DISO, and XOMO. All in all, you can mix low-risk ETFs with a handful of higher-risk ETFs to turn your inherited $400,000 into a fairly reliable monthly income-producing machine.The post Inherited $400,000?

With hundreds of dividend-paying companies in the industry, it is possible to choose high-yield stocks that have a steady record of rewarding shareholders and an ability to sustain dividends, even in tough times. The stock market has shown volatility since the start of the year amid recession concerns and tariff uncertainty. I continue to choose stocks that provide safety and passive income. I’ve invested in these dividend stocks for 15 years and they have become a core part of my passive income plan. These companies can not only sustain the dividends but also increase them in the coming years. Here are my top picks. Johnson &amp; Johnson A dividend portfolio remains incomplete without Johnson &amp; Johnson (NYSE: JNJ). One of the top healthcare stocks, the company is an exceptional brand with a global presence and a unique product line. The company has a lineup of medicines across different areas including oncology, neuroscience, and immunology. It holds more than 10 drugs which generate about $1 billion in sales each year. In the first quarter, the company saw a 2.4% jump in sales to $21.9 billion and it has increased the full-year sales guidance. Its EPS stood at $4.54 and the majority of the sales were driven by the innovative medicine segment. Additionally, the company has an impressive pipeline of drugs which means the company will keep growing even if the revenue increases at a slower pace. It also has the pricing power to handle negotiations with the U.S. Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS). The company has increased dividends for 63 consecutive years and currently has a yield of approximately 3.1%. Johnson &amp; Johnson has been around for over a century and it has seen it all. The healthcare leader is known as a Dividend King for a reason. 3M Another top pick, 3M (NYSE:MMM) is a highly diversified business and provides services in multiple industries. The company has four segments, namely, transportation, healthcare, safety, and industrial and consumer. The company achieved an organic sales growth of 1.5% and an EPS of $1.88, up 10% year over year in the first quarter. It reported slower growth but the management is expecting better earnings in the coming quarters. 3M is focusing on operational improvements to turn around the business. Trading for $149, the stock is up 15% year-to-date and 51% in 12 months. Despite the weak sales environment and ongoing market volatility, 3M hasn’t disappointed investors. CEO Bill Brown has laid out several initiatives to turn the business around. He is focusing on revitalizing new product introductions, which could improve sales growth and margins. MMM enjoys a dividend yield of 1.97% and has increased dividends for 65 years. While the short-term outlook may not look attractive, 3M is for long-term investors and its dividends are worth watching out for. There is no doubt that the industry is operating in an environment that is highly volatile right now. However, if the economic outlook improves through the de-escalation of the trade conflict, 3M has the potential to see higher sales and revenue. Coca Cola The top beverage giant is a favorite of Warren Buffett and he holds over 400 million shares in the company. Coke (NYSE: KO) is a highly diversified business with the most valuable brands including Sprite, Minute Maid, Fanta, and Diet Coke. In the first quarter, Coca-Cola reported sales of $11.22 billion and an EPS of 73 cents. Despite a 2% drop in net sales, the company saw a 6% rise in organic revenue. The management has maintained the full-year forecast and expects the tariff disruptions to be manageable. Despite the tariffs, it is a well-shielded company that will keep paying you each quarter. The company has raised dividends for over six decades and enjoys a yield of 2.84%. It announced a 5.2% year-over-year rise in the quarterly per-share payout and the company has the ability to afford to keep paying dividends. KO stock is exchanging hands for $71 and is up 16% year-to-date. This is a solid dividend stock to buy under $100. The name, reliability, and the global presence make Coca-Cola a top dividend king to own. I have held Coca-Cola for over 15 years and I am nowhere near giving up on it. Procter &amp; Gamble One of the largest consumer products companies, Procter &amp; Gamble Co. (NYSE: PG) has become a household name today. It is a leader in healthcare, beauty and grooming, and baby and family care. The company owns some of the biggest brands including Pampers, Gillette, Tide, Olay, and Pantene. Since it doesn’t rely on a particular country, brand, or category, it has a heavily diversified business that will keep generating revenue. It is in a better position to handle tariff-related issues and inflationary pressure. In the recently announced results, the company reported a 2% rise in net sales and a 3% jump in organic revenue. Its EPS came in at $1.88 and the management has reiterated the full-year outlook. Exchanging hands for $167, PG stock is flat year-to-date and up 2.8% in 12 months. The stock is far from cheap, it has a P/E ratio of 26.64, higher than its 10-year median of 25.7 but paying a premium for the stock might be worthwhile in an uncertain environment like today. The company has a dividend yield of 2.52% and it has increased dividends for 69 consecutive years. If you want to play super-safe, this is the Dividend king to own.

Wall Street Bullish on This Big Tech Stock 9:57 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street analysts have turned increasingly bullish on Amazon stock. Here&#8217;s a roundup of the most recent analyst moves: Earlier this week, BofA reiterated a Buy rating on AMZN and raised its price target from $230 to $248. The analysts highlighted Amazon’s advancements in robotics and AI, noting these could add approximately 2 percentage points to retail margins, supporting further upside. JPMorgan maintained an Overweight rating and increased its price target from $225 to $240. The firm emphasized Amazon’s leadership in e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS), along with margin tailwinds and a strong free cash flow (FCF) ramp, fueling a bullish long-term outlook. Barclays reiterated an Overweight rating with a price target of $240, noting that delays in Amazon’s Project Kuiper (satellite internet initiative) are expected and priced into the stock. They expressed confidence in Amazon’s 2025 launch cadence and cost guidance for the project. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets remain fickle, but today there is reason to be optimistic. Discussions have reemerged between the White House and Beijing, according to Chinese media reports. This has revived the &#8216;risk-on&#8217; trade and sent major stock market indices higher across the board. In a last-ditch effort, officials from both sides are trying to salvage trade talks that had previously stalled. Sectors of the economy are mixed today, with no clear conviction in either direction. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) has been capturing attention lately, most recently for announcing a $10 billion bet on AI-powered data centers in North Carolina. The stock is up 1.7% today. Additionally, the markets are keeping an eye on the broader S&amp;P 500 index, which will announce changes to its member lineup on Friday. Bank of America has offered its two cents, suggesting that AppLovin (Nasdaq: APP) and Carvana (NYSE: CVNA) could muscle their way into the index. Here’s a look at the performance as of morning trading: Dow Jones Industrial Average: Up 60.49 (+0.14%) Nasdaq Composite: 72.99 (+0.38%) S&amp;P 500: Up 16.85 (+0.28%) Market Movers In a bullish move for Big Tech, analyst firm Daiwa has reiterated its &#8220;outperform&#8221; rating on Nvidia (Nasdaq: NVDA) stock, lifting the price target to $165 per share, reflecting upside potential of 17%. Separately, Bank of America analysts reemphasized NVDA stock as one of their top picks with a $180 price objective, saying it&#8217;s in the best spot to capture the benefits of the &#8220;AI tide.&#8221; Tesla (Nasdaq: TSLA) is losing close to 5% today after Elon Musk turned his attention to the U.S. tax bill. Broadcom (Nasdaq: AVGO) will release its quarterly results after the closing bell today. The stock is trading slightly lower this morning. Procter &amp; Gamble (NYSE: PG), a Dow component, is down 1.4% after revealing massive layoffs to the tune of 7,000 jobs amid a wider corporate restructuring.

Wall Street Bullish on Big Tech 10:17 am by Gerelyn Terzo Wall Street analysts are showing growing optimism regarding Amazon stock. Below is a summary of the latest analyst actions: Earlier this week, BofA reconfirmed its Buy rating for Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN), elevating its price target from $230 to $248. The analysts underscored Amazon&#8217;s progress in robotics and artificial intelligence, suggesting these innovations could boost retail margins by roughly two percentage points, thereby supporting additional upside. JPMorgan sustained its Overweight rating and adjusted its price target upward from $225 to $240. The firm underscored Amazon&#8217;s dominant position in e-commerce and Amazon Web Services (AWS), alongside favorable margin trends and a robust FCF acceleration, contributing to a positive long-term outlook. Barclays maintained an Overweight rating with a $240 price target, commenting that anticipated delays in Amazon&#8217;s Project Kuiper (its satellite internet venture) are already factored into the stock&#8217;s valuation. They conveyed confidence in Amazon&#8217;s 2025 launch schedule and cost projections for the initiative. This article will be updated throughout the day, so check back often for more daily updates. The markets remain unpredictable, and today is no exception. After starting out of the gate higher on trade talk hopes, stocks have since erased those gains. According to Chinese state media, talks have resumed between the White House and Beijing. In a final push, officials from both nations are attempting to rescue stalled trade negotiations. This appeared to have reignited the &#8220;risk-on&#8221; sentiment, but the markets have since taken a nosedive. Economic sectors are showing mixed signals today, lacking a decisive direction. The SPDR S&amp;P 500 ETF (SPY) is now down 0.20% on the day. Amazon (Nasdaq: AMZN) has been in the spotlight recently, particularly after unveiling a $10 billion investment in AI-powered data centers in North Carolina. The stock has climbed 1.7% today.

It is a necessary qualifying component of the KYC (Know Your Customer) protocols for financial professionals, and is implemented to establish levels of investment risk that a new customer is comfortable taking. While the ideal investment delivers big capital appreciation and AAA principal safety, the maxim “no guts no glory” applies also to investing, where the largest returns are generally the ones that are the riskiest ventures. Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) are a popular vehicle for diversified investments, as they can be bought and sold online with ease and are usually subject to lower fees than mutual funds. ETFs come in a wide range of configurations, and are generally passively managed and designed to mimic the performance of designated market indexes. Key Points Dividend growth, in the majority of cases, is a stock indicator of a company’s business success, since dividend growth usually is commensurate with profit growth. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF is a popular ETF platform for investors to avail themselves of blue chip companies with a steady track record for both dividend increases and price appreciation growth. Deployment of a dividend reinvestment protocol can substantially boost overall ROI for investments in an ETF such as Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF.

The S&amp;P U.S. Dividend Growers Index is one such benchmark. Containing Dividend Kings (50 or more consecutive years of increased dividends) and Dividend Aristocrats (25 or more years in a row of increased dividends), this index contains Fortune 500 companies whose businesses are historically profitable enough that they can afford to continue higher dividend payouts year after year. The Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF (NYSE: VIG) is a popular ETF with a portfolio reflecting this exact index. Founded in 2006, the Vanguard Dividend Appreciation Index Fund ETF strives for a mix of capital appreciation and income from dividend growth companies, i.e. those with a history of dividend increases accompanying growth. Its yield is 1.87% and it has a 0.05% expense ratio. The dividend increases have to be consistent for a minimum of 10 years to warrant inclusion. Surprisingly, the top 25% companies with the highest yields are excluded from the 330+ stocks on the VIG roster. VIG has a Morningstar gold ETF ranking. It had $101.79 billion assets under management (AUM) as of the time of this writing. A look at VIG’s top 10 holdings shows how its criteria differ from S&amp;P 500 Index ETFs, which are usually led by Magnificent 7 stocks, based on market cap size: Broadcom Microsoft Apple Eli Lilly JP Morgan Chase Visa, Inc. Exxon Mobil MasterCard Costco Wholesale Walmart The VIG Dividend Difference As the calculator demonstrates, a $15,000 investment in VIG back in January, 2020 would be worth $25,833.91 today, at the time of this writing, which equates to a 72.23% ROI. The total return would be $10,833.91. The annualized return equates to 10.62%. This calculation also includes compounding through reinvested dividends. The reinvested dividend value is $2,425.58. The actual cash dividends paid out from the initial 119.67 shares equates to $1,849.45. If the dividends are not reinvested, the total return would be $8,408.33. Therefore, reinvesting the dividends enabled an additional return differential of $2,425.58 over the 5 year span. The Dividend Reinvestment Advantage For Safer Returns Dividend stocks with annual payout growth can boost capital appreciation through compounding, or provide extra income in the case of emergencies. As the charts demonstrate, reinvesting dividends contributed a 22% boost to ROI, while overall capital appreciation growth still averaged over 10% annually. Dividend Reinvestment Programs (DRIP) can automatically implement purchases of additional shares without additional fees or order entries, if one is so inclined. In the case of an ETF such as VIG, investors with weaker stomachs for volatility can sleep more easily, knowing that their portfolios are still growing albeit without the roller coaster ride delivered by Nvidia, for example. Another plus to VIG is that since it contains both current and potential future Dividend King and Dividend Aristocrat stocks, the dividend amounts will continue to grow with each passing year. This will, in turn, increase the amount of additional shares that can be obtained under a DRIP agreement. This is a classic compounding model for health building that can work for the benefit of many investors. On the contingency side, the investor can always cancel the DRIP agreement if there is an emergency need for the dividend income pending, since it can always be renewed at a later date after the crisis has passed.

WMT,2025-05-27 16:06:24,I have invested in dividends for 10 years—These are the blue-chip dividend payers I swear by,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/i-have-invested-in-dividends-for-10-yearsthese-are-20250527.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Key Points I swear by these three blue-chip dividend kings that have generated regular income for me. These are rock-solid businesses with the ability to increase their dividends in the future. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) I started my investment journey at a young age and my secret to investing is to buy blue-chip dividend stocks. All I wanted was steady passive income and I built a portfolio of some of the Dividend Aristocrats that never let me down. No matter where you are in your investment journey, if your goal is to make money through investments, pick dividend companies. Choose companies that have a history of rewarding shareholders and you will always have income flowing into your bank account. I’ve invested in these three dividend stocks for a decade and I’ve managed to build a resilient portfolio through dividend reinvestment. Coca-Cola A blue-chip dividend stock, Coca-Cola is a globally recognized brand. Over 100 years old, the company has expanded its offerings keeping the changing consumer preferences in mind. It owns some of the most famous brands including Coke, Minute Maid, Sprite, and Fanta. The company has a long-term growth strategy driven by successful marketing, innovation, and brand strength. In the first quarter, it reported a 6% rise in organic revenue and a 5% jump in price/mix. Coca-Cola has the pricing power to remain resilient even in times of geopolitical uncertainty. Exchanging hands for $71, KO stock is up 14% year-to-date and 11% in six months. The stock’s current dividend yield is 2.87% and it has increased dividends for 63 consecutive years which speaks a lot about the management. It has an annual dividend growth rate of 5.36% and a five-year growth rate of 4.07%. Coca-Cola’s 10-year dividend growth rate is 4.67%. When I bought the stock a decade ago, its annual dividend yield was 4.12% which remained steady until 2019. Since 2019, it has remained below 4% while the annual payout has steadily increased. The annual payout amount is currently the highest in the decade at $1.94 and the annual year-over-year payout growth is 5.43% Coca-Cola has a history of delivering steady gains despite market ups and downs. The company has remained resilient in times of a pandemic, and geopolitical tensions which makes it my top choice. Walmart Inc. When I invested in Walmart in 2015, it was the most convenient way to shop. With over 4,600 locations in the U.S., I could always find a Walmart near me. Founded 8 decades ago, the company is one of the largest retailers in terms of revenue. A blue-chip stock, Walmart has never disappointed. Despite the growing popularity of e-commerce, Walmart has retained its top spot. The company has paid a regular quarterly dividend for 51 years and it has a payout ratio of 51.04% which shows that the company is reinvesting the remaining of its earnings in the business. This also means there is a potential for a higher dividend in the coming years. Walmart’s dividend yield is 0.98% and its five-year dividend growth rate is 4.41%. Its 4-year average dividend yield is 1.39%. WMT stock’s 10-year dividend growth rate is 3.26% which is lower than the sector median of 5.93% but I like the stability Walmart brings to my investment portfolio. The Dividend King boosted the dividend by 13% recently. Exchanging hands for $95, the stock is up 6.5% year to date and 47% in the year. In the first quarter, it saw a 4.5% year-over-year jump in same-store sales, and advertising sales were up 50%. Walmart is investing in e-commerce and advertising which has helped with revenue growth. Truist Securities analyst has a price target of $111 per share and a buy rating. The business is stronger than ever and I’d hold on to the stock for at least another five years. Chevron Corporation I’ve always believed that the oil and gas sector is one of the most prominent sectors of the economy. There will never be a time when the world will not need oil and this means Chevron Corporation will never run out of business. Yes, the energy industry is volatile and the changing crude oil prices impact the stock but Chevron has managed to remain steady amid the volatility. A dividend stock, the company has increased dividends for 38 consecutive years. It has an attractive dividend yield of 4.8%, higher than the industry average of 3.6%. The company has a dividend payout ratio of 70.97% showing the management’s commitment towards rewarding shareholders. The quarterly dividends have gone from $1.07 in 2015 to $1.71 in 2025. Its 10-year dividend growth rate is 4.55% while the 3-year dividend growth rate is 6.56%. Chevron stock has never disappointed. It is up 49% in 5 years but the current market volatility and the drop in crude oil prices have impacted the stock which has lost 7.78% value year-to-date. Trading for $135, the stock is very close to the 52-week low of $132 and I consider this a solid chance to buy. Crude oil prices will rise and there will always be oil demand. Chevron has several assets that will keep generating revenue, one of the most prominent ones in the Permian basin. It is a rock-solid business with an attractive balance sheet and a steady dividend payout.

WMT,2025-05-28 14:06:21,Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/amazon-nasdaq-amzn-stock-price-prediction-for-2025-where-20250528.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Shares of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) lost 2.29% over the past five trading sessions, halting a rally that has seen the stock gain 23.16% since its year-to-date low of $167.32 on April 21. On the year, the e-commerce giant has seen its stock lose 6.42% despite beating on EPS and revenue by 16.77% and 0.35%, respectively, in Q1. Tempered forward guidance due to President Trump&#8217;s tariffs continues to cloud Amazon&#8217;s outlook. However, with the U.S. and China agreeing to a 90-day reduction in tariffs on May 11, there is renewed hope for the consumer discretionary mainstay, who has seen its one-year gain diminished to 12.28%. In its recent earnings call, Amazon reported that Q1 revenue growth and an operating income increase. Amazon Ads generated $13.9 billion in revenue alone, representing a 19% year-over-year increase, while AWS grew by 17% year-over-year to an annualized revenue run rate of $117 billion. Still, the stock remains down nearly 15% in 2025, with its one-year gain having been erased in Q1, which now stands at a 0.79% loss. In early April, Piper Sandler lowered its price target for Amazon to $215 from $265; however, the firm maintained its &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating saying it is looking for Q1 revenue of $153B and within the $151B–$155B guidance range. Piper forecasts AWS growth of 17% year-over-year. For Q2, the firm anticipates a guidance range of $157B–$162B and op income guidance of $14B–$18B. Piper lowered its 2025 ads revenue growth by about 1% and online stores and 3P services. Still, while there can be little doubt about its current financial health, investors and potential investors may be right to wonder whether growth can continue at Amazon&#8217;s historic pace, and whether the stock is safe as a long-term holding. Let&#8217;s take a look at where the share price could be headed. Key Points in This Article: Amazon is facing substantial headwinds this year, but the stock remains fundamentally sound with a &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. AWS, AI and ad sales continue to be major drivers for the Magnificent Seven stock. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Amazon? In the past 20 years, Amazon&#8217;s stock is up more than 9,188%. The company has been called one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world, and its brand is one of the world&#8217;s most valuable. Though the stock tumbled as the COVID-19 pandemic waned and lockdowns ended (along with the broader markets), it has more than recovered. Shares of this Magnificent Seven member hit an all-time high on Feb. 4, 2025, but with the Nasdaq briefly entering bear market territory in March, it had been downhill for Amazon in 2025. There have been signs of hope recently, with AMZN rebounding along with the broad market. It is hard to imagine that the company or its share price will collapse any time soon, but analysts and investors may see the stock as overbought. Let&#8217;s see what Wall Street expects. Amazon as a Company The company engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores internationally. It also manufactures and sells electronic devices and develops and produces media content. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides compute, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and other services. And Amazon Prime is the company&#8217;s membership program. Amazon is based in Seattle. It was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, the former chief executive officer and now executive board chair. Amazon went public in May 1997. Its retail competitors include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). It also competes with the likes of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company continues its push into artificial intelligence with an update of its Alexa feature to Alexa+. AWS investments in cloud computing and AI also continue, with the former being the world&#8217;s largest cloud services provider and the latter nearing its debut of its &#8220;Nova&#8221; chatbot, which will compete in price with ChatGPT. Additionally, Amazon has been expanding its same-day delivery services, and its entertainment division has secured the James Bond franchise with the acquisition of MGM Studios. Headwinds include ongoing labor issues. The most recent quarterly results showed strong performance, with AWS as a major growth driver. Amazon as a Stock Since hitting its all-time high on Feb. 4, the stock has sunk 15.15%. Note that Wall Street analysts&#8217; $240.62 consensus price target is just shy of Amazon&#8217;s all-time high share price seen earlier this year. Of the 48 analysts covering AMZN, all but one assign it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, with the other assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. Loop Capital and Wells Fargo recently reiterated buy-equivalent ratings, and with 64.01% of shares held by institutional investors — including notable stakes from the three largest asset management companies, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — the stock is popular among Wall Street&#8217;s sell-side firms. Institutional holdings of Amazon have seen net increase with 2,927 position increases versus 2,426 position decreases. Wall Street expectations for where the stock goes in the next 52 weeks vary. While analysts overall anticipate healthy upside, the lowest price target indicates a decline in the share price. The consensus projection signals strong upside potential for the next 52 weeks, based on strong forward guidance for business segments like AWS and Prime Video&#8217;s ad sales, which saw enormous year-over-year increases as the platform now hosts the NFL&#8217;s Thursday Night Football programming. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $195.00 -5.02% Median $240.62 17.19% High $305.00 48.55% Amazon does face some headwinds and risks in addition to those mentioned above. Consumers appear to be pulling back on spending due to ongoing inflation, contracting GDP in Q1 and the possibility of a recession in 2025. Over the past month, however, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&amp;P 500 — into which Amazon falls — has performed admirably, posting a gain of 18.14%, second only to tech&#8217;s gain of 21.31% over the same period. That rebound represents a stark difference from the sector&#8217;s last-place performance among the S&amp;P 500&#8217;s 11 sectors through Q1 2025. While the company dominates in the retail space and is a tech leader, competition in neither category is likely to go away anytime soon. All these things could have a huge impact on profitability. Despite some skeptics, the prospects for Amazon are optimistic overall, especially in the short term. Wall Street&#8217;s &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; consensus rating and the upside potential far outweigh the downside potential shares of AMZN face.

The popular hot dog brand confirmed Friday plans to add restaurants to multiple Walmart stores, starting with six owned and operated by local high-caliber franchisees. According to Wienerschnitzel, the Walmart restaurants will enable the company to ""[expand] into target markets through non-traditional avenues."" Where Will They Be Located? The six restaurants are set to open by this fall in Walmart stores in the following communities: The Walmart locations will all feature the chain's full menu, including iconic items like the chili cheese dog, junkyard dog, chili cheese fries, jalapeño poppers and ""tastee freez"" soft serve desserts. As the brand looks to scale its presence, these partnerships provide a blueprint for future growth while maintaining its iconic brand appeal, according to Wienerschnitzel. A Walmart spokesperson noted the store chain is ""always looking for prospective tenants, excited to possibly bring their business to our stores."" Growing Brands According to Wienerschnitzel, the move into Walmart stores sparks a new focus on non-traditional growth for the company. Supporting this expansion and fueling the brand's momentum are strategic new hires like Shak Turner, the brand's newest director of franchise expansion. Turner, who joined the company in March, will mainly focus on driving growth across non-traditional formats and attracting high-ranking multi-unit franchise candidates, according to Wienerschnitzel. ""Wienerschnitzel has spent decades building a strong reputation, especially on the West Coast, and this expansion into Walmart stores signifies a new era of growth for the brand,"" Turner said in a news release. ""It's clear Wienerschnitzel's unique concept fills a specific void for multi-brand franchisees looking to grow their portfolios, which is one of the elements that attracted me to the brand initially. I'm thrilled to join this amazing team and play a part in spearheading initiatives and new partnerships, which will no doubt catapult the brand to new markets."" There are currently 340 franchised Wienerschnitzel locations in operation throughout 13 states, and more than 50 units in various stages of development across the U.S., according to the company. Founded by John Galardi in 1961 with a single hot dog stand in Wilmington, Calif., the company now bills itself as ""the world's largest hot dog chain."" Based in Tustin, Calif., Galardi Group Inc. franchises 340 Wienerschnitzel restaurants in 13 states. The group is also the parent company and franchisor of Hamburger Stand and Tastee Freez, LLC. This week, Walmart confirmed plans to open five new stores and a new Sam's Club location by the end of September, with a total of 10 new stores planned to be open by the end of 2025.

You likely have a pretty good idea of how much the family spends on food monthly. If you told your family members exactly what this number is, they&#8217;d likely be shocked. Key Points The cost of groceries is only going up, but it shouldn’t be a family’s biggest expense. In the case of this Redditor, the family is spending a good portion of their monthly income on food and dining out. There are several ways to reduce the cost of groceries, such as meal prepping each week. Are you spending too much money on groceries? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) How much a family spends on groceries is exactly what one Redditor posting in r/MiddleClassFinance is worried about. In this family&#8217;s case, it&#8217;s far too easy to get carried away with overspending each month, especially when it comes to dining out. Large Grocery Bill What&#8217;s surprising is that this Redditor outright admits the family spends around $1,400 per month on groceries. For a family of three, including a two-year-old, this is entirely too much money. Having tracked their spending since June 2024, there is a real-world concern. When the Redditor breaks down this total number, we learn that the family’s average monthly grocery bill is $692. Additionally, they are spending $405 on fast food and takeout, as well as $289 on dining out. For a family earning around $9,000 per month, this number should be alarming. In fact, the grocery budget is likely their second biggest expense, after a mortgage, which is a reasonable concern. If the question is whether or not they are spending too much, the answer is a resounding yes. Average Monthly Spend According to the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, the average monthly cost of groceries is $504 as of late 2024. The total annual cost for families should be approximately $6,043. Compared to other families, this family spends over $16,000 on food and groceries each month, far exceeding the average amount typically spent by families. Another consideration is that the US Department of Agriculture states that, for a family of four, the monthly budget in March 2025 should be $996. Even if you subtract a little for a family of three, their total expense is still well outpacing what the agreed-upon spending should be for a family. How to Spend Smarter First and foremost, this family and Redditor need to set up a detailed monthly budget to look at where they can cut back. Spending half of their grocery bill on food that is made at home is crazy. In other words, eating out and or bringing food in has to stop immediately. Setting a Budget There should be a budget set for how many times a month the family will order in or take out, and that’s all they can do for the whole month. Grocery spending is a necessity, but dining out or ordering fast food is a luxury. As a result, it shouldn’t be too challenging to make this change. Finding Coupons In addition, this family needs to become more savvy about coupons, discount grocery stores, and taking advantage of farmers’ markets, among other strategies. Using websites like iBotta or Coupons.com to save money can be a real advantage. Yes, it takes a little extra time to go through and save digital coupons, but the payoff is quickly evident in the savings. Meal Prepping Another potential option is meal prep for the family, which provides a set menu for the week. Let’s assume the family goes to the grocery shops on the weekend. This allows them to meal prep for the week, including lunches and dinners, which is likely where most of the excess spending goes. House Brands Another consideration is to buy generic brands at the grocery store, such as those from Great Value at Walmart or Favorite Day at Target. The savings here can really add up, and the food rarely tastes any different, so there is plenty of money to be saved. As someone who regularly buys Target’s house brands, I can personally attest to there being very little difference in taste, except that everything costs less.

The Dividends subreddit was bustling after one investor asked if people regretted buying dividend stocks too early or too late in their journey. For instance, some people may regret buying dividend stocks in their 20s because they saw growth stocks outperform them for more than a decade. On the other hand, other investors may wish they got into dividend stocks in their 40s instead of waiting for their 60s due to market volatility and steep losses from unprofitable investments. Dividend investors shared their thoughts and some advice for people who are considering dividend stocks. Key Points Should you buy dividend stocks in your 20s? Redditors shared their thoughts. Dividend growth stocks make more sense for younger investors, but high-yield stocks become a priority as people get older and approach retirement. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Buy Stocks For The Long Run One of the top comments came from a Walmart (NYSE:WMT) investor who bought shares at $6 apiece and held on to them. The investor now has 1,110 shares and receives an annual dividend that is close to 16% of the initial investment. That&#8217;s the advantage of buying dividend growth stocks. These corporations pay dividends but still have plenty of growth prospects left. Even at its current level of success, Walmart still has growth opportunities. Online advertising, e-commerce, and retail locations are some of the company&#8217;s growth levers. Buying dividend stocks doesn&#8217;t mean you have to be stuck with mature, high-yield companies. For instance, Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) has a dividend yield above 1% and has crushed the stock market with a 685% gain over the past five years. Why Wait To Invest? Multiple dividend investors asked why people would wait to invest. Some people said they wished they could invest when they were born, while others wished they invested in their early 20s. People weren&#8217;t expressing regret about entering stocks in their 20s and 30s. Waiting to invest doesn&#8217;t make much sense if you want to become wealthy. The longer you let your money sit in the stock market, the more time you have to compound your returns. Waiting to invest causes your money to lose value due to inflation. A high-yield savings account is better than nothing, but it can&#8217;t appreciate like dividend stocks. You only get the cash flow from a bank account, while dividend stocks can double in value over the course of 5-10 years. Transition To High-Yield Dividend Stocks When You Need Steady Income A few dividend investors said that it makes sense to diversify into high-yield stocks when they need additional income. Many investors focused on dividend growth stocks or index funds that tracked major indices like the S&amp;P 500 when they were younger. Then, they gradually sold off some of those holdings and shifted into funds with lower risk and higher yields. Every person has a different financial situation and long-term goals. If you don&#8217;t need to sell your assets within the next decade and don&#8217;t need dividend income, it may make more sense to focus on growth-oriented opportunities. However, your plans may look different if you want to sell your stocks in 1-3 years to buy a house. Then, it may be better to take a cautious approach and focus on funds that have high yields and steady growth instead of riskier funds that aim to produce 10%+ annualized returns. If you&#8217;re just getting started, you can diversify your portfolio with dividend stocks and growth-oriented stocks. Reinvesting dividends ensures that your dividend income grows over time and can eventually cover your living expenses. Monitoring dividend stocks can help you build a robust portfolio that aligns with your risk tolerance.

Enter Aldi and Walmart, two of the more affordable grocery options available to most people. Key Points This Redditor is trying to gauge whether others agree with his assessment of which grocery store is cheaper. Comparing Walmart and Aldi pricing isn’t new, as both of these grocers aim to save people money. When you need more than just groceries, Walmart is the easy choice, offering a wide range of options, including electronics and a pharmacy. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) For one Redditor, they are trying to decide exactly which one of these two stores is less expensive. Posting in r/MiddleClassFinance, their admittedly unpopular opinion is that these two stores are far closer in pricing than most people believe. Grocery Shopping Duel It should go without saying that for most people, Aldi and Walmart are considered two of the least expensive grocery options. In this Redditor’s eyes, when they did some research on everyday items like milk, eggs, or meat, there was almost no difference in price. In fact, after becoming an Aldi believer for a while, the original poster switched back to Walmart after realizing they were not saving all that much. As a family of five living in Michigan, this Redditor is likely looking at slightly higher grocery bills with a few extra mouths to feed. However, they are also away from coastal cities where prices tend to be a little higher. So, is it true that Aldi and Walmart are close in price, or is this Redditor’s belief solely reserved for their scenario? Which Store Is Actually Cheaper? Even a quick Google search will tell you that Walmart and Aldi are likely to trade positions as the least expensive grocers. In the case of meat, there is a good chance that Aldi will win; however, as of the beginning of June 2025, online pricing is relatively even for eggs. The same goes for milk, where both stores are under $3 for 2% milk, so it’s a tie here as well. If you are someone who loves Almond Milk, Aldi takes the win. However, as you continue to explore other options, such as bananas, pasta sauces, and even dish soap, Aldi is generally a little less expensive. However, there is a significant caveat to saying that while Aldi might be cheaper, in some cases, “cheaper” only means a few pennies. In other words, this Redditor’s belief that these two stores are relatively close in price is not far off from reality. Moving on to the comments on this post, there is a fairly healthy debate about which one is cheaper, with no clear winner. Aldi does seem to receive more praise from people who regularly shop at both, but even they admit that the price difference is relatively small. What About Quality? While Aldi and Walmart may be close in price, it immediately raises the question of which store offers better quality. In this case, there is a pretty convincing argument that Aldi wins this category. It’s hard to pinpoint when Walmart’s reputation for quality began to take a hit, but it has certainly developed a reputation for being of lesser quality than its competitors. In the case of the original poster, they admit that while their Walmart has pretty good fruit, they have been to others where they wouldn’t touch the fruit at all. Other Redditors in the comments echo the same sentiment, expressing concerns that the quality of Aldi&#8217;s produce, pantry goods, meat, and other fresh goods is far superior. Aldi has a standout reputation right now for offering great quality at low prices, giving it an easy win in this category. The caveat is that if there isn’t an Aldi near you, shopping at Walmart will not only not break the bank, but you can certainly find quality items if you spend some time digging through fruits and vegetables. Of course, if you need something other than food, such as electronics or clothing, or want to buy a large quantity of plastic spoons and plates for a birthday party, there is a good chance most people will go to Walmart first.

Additionally, the chain also plans to open more stores in 2026, making it even easier for shoppers across the U.S. to purchase tools, appliances, building materials and more all under one roof. New Store Locations USA Today reports Lowe's plans to open five to 10 new stores this year, two of which have already opened in Magnolia and Fort Worth, Texas. Additionally, a store in Asheville, N.C., that was closed due to Hurricane Helene in September has since reopened. A Lowe's spokesperson also confirmed to USA Today the company plans to open new stores in Georgetown, Texas, and Maricopa, Ariz., later this year. According to a store directory on the company's website, Lowe's operates over 100 stores in Texas and more than 30 in Arizona. Lowe's also operates over 100 stores in North Carolina where the company is headquartered. More Stores To Come In December, Lowe's held its 2024 analyst and investor conference to provide updates on its key growth and productivity initiatives and near-term and long-term financial targets. During the event, the company announced plans to expand its footprint and attract new customers to the brand by opening 10 to 15 stores per year over the next several years in fast-growing markets in the U.S., according to a news release posted to the company's website. ""In planning this next phase of store expansion, the company will build on the success of its recent new store openings, while also leveraging its enhanced space productivity initiatives,"" the release reads. ""With these new stores, the company expects to strengthen its brand position, build its customer base and drive incremental sales and return on invested capital."" According to USA Today, the company's plans for five to 10 new stores in 2025 accounts for time needed to ramp up their opening efforts, and the projected 10 to 15 new stores per year will start in 2026. Store Openings In 2025 Lowe's is just one of several companies to recently announce expansion plans for the remainder of 2025 and into 2026. Furniture retailer IKEA confirmed in May the company has already opened four ""plan and order"" points with pick-up locations, as well as one pick-up point location, thus far in 2025. A company spokesperson said IKEA plans to open three more stores and three more plan and order point with pick up locations before the end of the year, and two more are already in the works for 2026. Walmart also confirmed last month about 10 new stores are scheduled to open by the end of 2025, five of which are set to open by September. Meanwhile, popular hot dog chain Wienerschnitzel confirmed plans to add restaurants to multiple Walmart stores, starting with six owned and operated by local high-caliber franchisees. Grocery store chain Wegmans Food Markets confirmed Friday plans to open a total of three stores this year, with one already open and two more scheduled to open this summer. Culver's, a beloved fast food chain specializing in burgers, chicken and frozen treats, has already opened new restaurants in 15 states thus far in 2025 and has broken ground on new restaurants planned for communities in 12 states. Restaurant chain Raising Cane's, which specializes in chicken finger meals and combos, recently announced plans for new locations in Massachusetts and Connecticut as the company continues to expand throughout the Northeast.",https://www.patch.com/us/across-america/popular-home-improvement-chain-set-open-new-stores-2025-report

The violent takedown, which was caught on video, prompted a protest later that evening. Now, Rep. Linda Sánchez is demanding answers from federal officials about the incident and several other raids in the area that appear to target workers based on their ethnicity, she said in a letter to the Secretary of the Department of Homeland Security, the Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and the U.S. Attorney General. Federal authorities conducted raids at multiple sites in the Southeast Los Angeles County city, including a Food 4 Less on Whittier Boulevard and a Lowes Home Improvement store on Washington Boulevard, where the confrontation occurred. Footage from the incident obtained by KTLA shows several masked border patrol agents in a struggle with a 20-year-old Adrian Andrew Martinez. Amid the scuffle, someone can be heard screaming, ""He's a U.S. citizen!"" In the video, Martinez appeared to be resisting efforts to handcuff him, but he was quickly taken to the ground, detained and put in the back of a U.S. Customs and Border Protection vehicle. Martinez, was on a break from his job at a nearby Walmart when he called out the border patrol agent's questioning of an elderly man in the parking lot, KTLA reported. Witness Oscar Preciado said Martinez was only questioning the officers when they put their hands on him. ""They started yelling at us, 'Get back. Get back. Get back.' While they were pushing one of the other guys, they threw him to the floor twice by the neck, just for standing up for his coworker, who they were grabbing,"" Preciado told ABC7. ""They’re saying that he attacked them so they want to press charges,"" his mother, Mayra Villarreal, told Fox 11. Reached for comment, a Customs and Border Protection spokesperson told Patch ""the videos are missing critical moments and don’t tell the whole story."" ""Border Patrol agents conducted roving patrol duties in the city of Pico Riviera, CA. While making effecting the arrest of an illegal alien at the Lowe's store at 8600 Washington Blvd., agents were confronted by a hostile group that attempted to interfere with their duties. During the interference, an agent was punched in the face and another agent was struck in the arm by a member of the group. Despite interference from the growing crowd and resistance by the subject, he was taken into custody,"" the spokesperson wrote. The case has been presented to the U.S. Attorney’s Office, with the suspect facing prosecution on a charge of impeding or assaulting a federal Officer, according to CBP. The spokesman confirmed Martinez was in federal custody Wednesday afternoon. Sanchez (D-Whittier) said she has been working with the Hernandez family to locate Adrian, and connect him with his parents. “I am deeply troubled that a U.S. citizen, who supports his family by working at Walmart, and is, by all accounts, an upstanding member of his community, continues to be detained by the federal government,” Congresswoman Sánchez wrote. “Furthermore, upon learning more details of the raid and others occurring throughout Los Angeles, I am deeply concerned that the specific immigration raid that took place at this Walmart seems to be in violation of 42 U.S. Code § 1985, which states that targeting workers on the basis of their race, as well as subsequent use of excessive force, is a blatant violation of their civil rights.” Her letter further demanded responses from federal officials about the legal authority for holding Hernandez and whether border patrol agents had warrants to engage in immigration enforcement at the Pico Rivera Towne Center as well as who they were targeting and why. Tuesday's events also prompted city officials to release a statement. ""The City of Pico Rivera is aware and can confirm recent reports on immigration control operations conducted by the United States Immigration and Customs Control Service (ICE) within our city. These actions have, understandably, generated worry, fear and anxiety among many of our residents,"" the city wrote. ""We want to be clear: The City of Pico Rivera and Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department are not involved, cooperating with, or supporting, in any way, federal immigration control operations. Our city maintains its steadfast commitment to protecting the rights and dignity of all people, regardless of their migrant status. Each person has the right to due process as guaranteed by the Constitution,"" the statement continued. ""We are deeply concerned about the tone and nature of these recent actions. Reports of aggressive tactics, arrests without warrants and operatives that appear to target specific communities raise serious doubts about the proportionality, justice and legality of the process."" The protest lasted for hours after news of the raids, with marchers traveling from City Hall to the corner of Rosemead and Washington boulevards. Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department deputies monitored the demonstration, but no arrests were reported.

If all goes according to plan, with no delays, Economic Development Director Jake Melrose said the store is slated to open in October 2026, per Mayor John Argoudelis. So far, contractors have started pushing dirt, and Argoudelis expects the building to start going up later this year. The employee-owned company, founded in 1919, purchased the 36-acre lot where it plans to open a 240,000-square-foot store and a fuel center featuring a car wash, convenience store and oil change center. The site would also feature seven outlots open to additional development, Patch reported. RELATED: Woodman's Food Market Proposes Plainfield Store, Fuel Station With the new grocery store option will come a brand-new, fully improved intersection at 119th Street and Route 59. That entails dedicated left, right and through turn lanes, full crosswalks, and new light signals — ""all the bells and whistles ... that'll help traffic flow immensely,"" Argoudelis told Patch in January. As of Patch's previous update in January, the village was hopeful that Woodman's would open by the year's end. Plainfield staff first began working with the Woodman's team immediately following Walmart's closure in March 2023 to potentially redevelop the vacant lot, but efforts were unsuccessful, Patch reported. Woodman's location would allow the grocery store to provide locals with a ""better finished product than anything that was afforded to them by the former [Walmart] location.""",https://www.patch.com/illinois/plainfield/plainfield-staff-eye-opening-date-new-woodmans-grocery-store

Due to his unreliable predictions and over-the-top policy complaints, investors would be better served by focusing on company fundamentals. Nvidia made early investors rich, but there is a new class of &#8216;Next Nvidia Stocks&#8217; that could be even better. Click here to learn more. A Controversial Track Record Jim Cramer is a polarizing figure in financial media, known for hosting CNBC’s Mad Money and co-anchoring Squawk on the Street. A Harvard-educated former hedge fund manager, Cramer’s high-energy stock picks and market commentary have made him a household name among retail investors. However, his predictions are frequently criticized for their inconsistency, with many noting he’s often wrong about his stock calls. This reputation led to the creation of the Inverse Cramer ETF, which aimed to profit by betting against his recommendations. Although the ETF shut down due to lack of interest, an X account named “Inverse Cramer” continues to mock his calls, highlighting his spotty track record. Cramer’s bold, sometimes erratic takes &#8212; such a a recent essay he wrote on a so-called “Trump discount” &#8212; often spark debate, with critics pointing to his tendency to overemphasize short-term noise over long-term fundamentals, making his advice a risky bet for investors. Cramer’s “Trump Discount” Thesis In his June 1 article, Jim Cramer argues that a “Trump discount” is suppressing U.S. stock market performance due to the unpredictability of President Trump’s policies. He contrasts Europe’s “consistency of mediocrity” with U.S. volatility, claiming the White House’s immense power creates instability. Cramer cites examples across sectors: Nvidia’s (NASDAQ:NVDA) gains were short-lived due to policy uncertainty; retail stocks like Walmart (NYSE:WMT) face tariff-related confusion; drug companies suffer from shifting Medicare pricing policies and vaccine skepticism; food companies like Campbell’s (NYSE:CPB) face regulatory pressure from RFK Jr.; Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) struggles with Trump’s push for U.S.-only manufacturing; software and internet giants like Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) and Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG)(NASDAQ:GOOGL) face unexpected scrutiny; banks see no regulatory relief; mergers and acquisitions are stalled by unpredictable cash flows; and energy stocks, despite Trump’s pro-drilling stance, lack momentum due to high costs and regulatory hurdles. Cramer predicts continued market declines, noting a recent 1% S&amp;P 500 drop, exacerbated by mixed signals about U.S.-China trade talks. Flaws in Cramer’s Argument Cramer’s thesis appears flawed for several reasons. First, his “Trump discount” overstates the impact of presidential policies on broad market performance. The S&amp;P 500, far from being discounted, has gained since he wrote his article, and is near record highs, contradicting his bearish outlook. Second, his sector-specific arguments lack depth. Nvidia’s volatility is more tied to market cycles and competition than Trump’s policies. Retailers like Costco (NASDAQ:COST) and TJX (NYSE:TJX) have thrived despite tariff fears, with Costco’s stock rising due to strong fundamentals, not a “Trump premium.” Third, Cramer’s focus on short-term policy noise ignores long-term drivers like corporate earnings and consumer demand. His concerns about drug stocks, which he ties to RFK Jr.’s influence, overstate the impact of unconfirmed regulatory changes, since Medicare negotiation frameworks remain complex and slow-moving. Similarly, his critique of Apple misinterprets global supply chain dynamics; India’s manufacturing shift is a strategic diversification, not a policy misstep. Cramer’s Track Record and Market Misreads Cramer’s historical inaccuracy fuels skepticism. The Inverse Cramer ETF, though defunct, capitalized on his poor track record, and the ongoing X account highlights his frequent misses. His alarmist tone, comparing Trump’s influence to Andrew Jackson’s era, exaggerates political impact while downplaying market resilience. For instance, energy stocks’ stagnation is less about Trump’s policies and more about global oil prices and ESG pressures, which Cramer barely addresses. His claim that Europe’s markets outperform due to “consistency” ignores their own challenges, like Germany’s 2025 economic slowdown. By fixating on sensationalized policy risks, Cramer overlooks broader market trends, such as technology-driven gains and robust consumer spending, which have propelled the S&amp;P 500 upward. Key Takeaways As always, focus on fundamentals, not noise. Investors should tune out sky-is-falling narratives like Cramer’s, which amplify short-term concerns over fundamentals. However, blind optimism about endless market gains is equally misguided. Markets naturally rise and fall, influenced by policies but driven by earnings, innovation, and economic cycles. While presidential actions, like tariffs or deregulation, can create volatility, they don’t dictate long-term outcomes. Investors would do well to focus on business fundamentals &#8212; revenue growth, profit margins, and competitive advantages &#8212; rather than reacting to pundits like Cramer. Consistent, long-term investing, diversified across sectors, remains the most reliable path to wealth creation, regardless of political headlines.

Meanwhile, the VYM ETF can stabilize your portfolio through blue-chip diversification and still provide decent dividends. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) Today, we&#8217;re sizing up two amazing funds in a head-to-head competition. One is an exchange traded fund (ETF) called the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF (NYSEARCA:MSTY), which derives substantial income from Microstrategy (NASDAQ:MSTR) stock. The other is the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF (NYSEARCA:VYM), which provides ample dividends and share-price stability. So, it&#8217;s a choice between insanely high monthly cash distributions with MSTY or stable blue-chip dividend power with VYM. Or maybe you can own both of these funds if you have a plan in place. By combining big yield with safety-first measures, investors can maximize their income potential without jeopardizing their financial well-being. MSTY: Stunning Yield, Monthly Payouts It&#8217;s easy to see why the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF garners so much attention. First of all, the fund is centered around MSTR stock, and Microstrategy is a famous technology company that invests in Bitcoin (CRYPTO:BTC). How much Bitcoin? As of March 31, 2025, Microstrategy held 528,185 Bitcoins and reported a digital asset carrying value totaling $43,546,079. That&#8217;s a whole lot of cryptocurrency, and if the Bitcoin price goes up, MSTR stock and the MSTY ETF will also probably move higher. So, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF is associated with a well-known company (Microstrategy) and the world&#8217;s most famous cryptocurrency (Bitcoin). Yet, there&#8217;s another reason why investors are flocking to MSTY in droves. Specifically, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF offers an annual distribution rate (which is similar to a forward annual dividend yield) of 88.8%. Not only that, but the fund pays out its distributions on a monthly basis, so you wouldn&#8217;t have to wait several months to start getting the cash payments. Issues to Consider With MSTY The fund&#8217;s benefits might make the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF hard to resist. On the other hand, there are issues with the MSTY ETF that prospective investors ought to weigh carefully. To start off, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF automatically deducts 0.99% worth of annualized operating expenses from the share price. Never forget that annual fees can diminish your profits and deepen your losses over time. Next, there are risks associated with the options-trading strategies that the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF uses. Along with holding U.S. Treasury bonds, the MSTY ETF indirectly participates in Microstrategy stock ownership though synthetic option strategies. Then, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF writes (sells) covered calls to generate income. This enables MSTY to provide nearly 89% annual yield before expenses. However, this covered call strategy also limits MSTY&#8217;s share-price upside potential when Microstrategy stock goes higher. As a result, in terms of share-price performance, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF could end up doing much worse than Microstrategy stock. VYM: Solid Yield and Blue-Chip Benefits So far, we&#8217;ve discovered that the MSTY ETF could put large monthly payouts in your portfolio. Yet, the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF could seriously underperform Microstrategy stock and the fund&#8217;s current yield isn&#8217;t guaranteed for the future. One way to avoid these issues is to stick to a safer, more stable fund like the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF. Instead of using options-trading strategies for just one stock, the VYM ETF focuses on a wide range of highly established blue-chip stocks across multiple market sectors. The Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF&#8217;s basket of stocks includes retail giant Walmart (NYSE:WMT), energy mammoth Exxon Mobil (NYSE:XOM), home improvement behemoth Home Depot (NYSE:HD), financial-sector leader JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM), and technology titan Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO). In total, the VYM ETF&#8217;s diversified portfolio comprises 585 stocks. Maybe the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF doesn&#8217;t capture the excitement of a Bitcoin-associated fund like MSTY. Nevertheless, VYM&#8217;s long-term investors should be quite pleased with the fund&#8217;s share-price appreciation. Low Fees, Respectable Yield There are other advantages, as well, such as the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF&#8217;s ultra-low expense ratio (i.e., annual management fees) of 0.06%. This compares favorably to the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF, which deducts operating expenses of 0.99% per year. Next, investors should take note of the VYM ETF&#8217;s forward annual dividend yield, which is 2.63%. Granted, this isn&#8217;t headline-grabbing like the nearly 89% annual distribution rate that the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF currently features. Still, the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF offers greater stability, reasonable fees, and a relative sense of safety. Besides, a 2.63% yield is perfectly respectable, so let&#8217;s maintain a reasonable perspective and not be too greedy. Get the Best of Both Worlds After discussing these two intriguing funds, it might seem like you have to choose between fabulously high yield or diversified blue-chip stability. In reality, however, it&#8217;s possible to get the best of both worlds. Since the YieldMax MSTR Option Income Strategy ETF is comparatively high-risk, you could buy just a few shares for extra high-yield portfolio power. After that, you can buy some shares of the Vanguard High Dividend Yield ETF as a portfolio anchor that gets decent yield. In the end, you&#8217;ll get exposure to plenty of established blue-chip names with VYM and a Bitcoin-based yield boost with MSTY. If implemented carefully, this strategy may be your best bet for passive income in 2025&#8217;s second half.The post MSTY vs. VYM: Insane Monthly Yields or Blue-Chip Dividend Power? appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/06/27/msty-vs-vym-insane-monthly-yields-or-blue-chip-dividend-power/

(NASDAQ:AMZN) gained 6.43% over the past five trading sessions, bringing the e-commerce and cloud storage solutions stock&#8217;s year-to-date gain to 1.40%. Over the past year, it is up 13.24% In early June, Bank of America raised the its price target on Amazon.com to $248 from $230, maintaining its &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, citing recent Software-as-a-Service and retail sector multiple expansion. Amazon now has over 750,000 robots assisting with 75% of customer orders, but with AI capabilities ramping up, its first twelfth generation automated fulfillment center launched in late-2024 and eight new robots — just announced in May — are primarily focused on delivery station efficiencies. The robotics cycle is &#8220;early,&#8221; according to Bank of America&#8217;s analyst, who expects Amazon to leverage robots to reduce labor dependency, increase order accuracy and improve warehouse efficiency, driving material cost savings. In its first-quarter earnings call, Amazon reported that Q1 revenue growth and an operating income increase. Amazon Ads generated $13.9 billion in revenue alone, representing a 19% year-over-year increase, while AWS grew by 17% year-over-year to an annualized revenue run rate of $117 billion. Still, the stock remains down nearly 15% from its all-time high on Feb. 4, with its one-year gain now standing at 15.87%. Still, while there can be little doubt about its current financial health, investors and potential investors may be right to wonder whether growth can continue at Amazon&#8217;s historic pace, and whether the stock is safe as a long-term holding. Let&#8217;s take a look at where the share price could be headed. Key Points in This Article: Amazon is facing substantial headwinds this year, but the stock remains fundamentally sound with a &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. AWS, AI and ad sales continue to be major drivers for the Magnificent Seven stock.

This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Amazon? In the past 20 years, Amazon&#8217;s stock is up more than 9,188%. The company has been called one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world, and its brand is one of the world&#8217;s most valuable. Though the stock tumbled as the COVID-19 pandemic waned and lockdowns ended (along with the broader markets), it has more than recovered. Shares of this Magnificent Seven member hit an all-time high on Feb. 4, 2025, but with the Nasdaq briefly entering bear market territory in March, it had been downhill for Amazon in 2025. There have been signs of hope recently, with AMZN rebounding along with the broad market. It is hard to imagine that the company or its share price will collapse any time soon, but analysts and investors may see the stock as overbought. Let&#8217;s see what Wall Street expects. Amazon as a Company The company engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores internationally. It also manufactures and sells electronic devices and develops and produces media content. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides compute, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and other services. And Amazon Prime is the company&#8217;s membership program. Amazon is based in Seattle. It was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, the former chief executive officer and now executive board chair. Amazon went public in May 1997. Its retail competitors include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). It also competes with the likes of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company continues its push into artificial intelligence with an update of its Alexa feature to Alexa+. AWS investments in cloud computing and AI also continue, with the former being the world&#8217;s largest cloud services provider and the latter nearing its debut of its &#8220;Nova&#8221; chatbot, which will compete in price with ChatGPT. Additionally, Amazon has been expanding its same-day delivery services, and its entertainment division has secured the James Bond franchise with the acquisition of MGM Studios. Headwinds include ongoing labor issues. The most recent quarterly results showed strong performance, with AWS as a major growth driver. Amazon as a Stock Since hitting its all-time high on Feb. 4, the stock has lost 8.50%. Note that Wall Street analysts&#8217; median price target of $243.24 is just shy of Amazon&#8217;s all-time high share price seen earlier this year. Of the 49 analysts covering AMZN, all but one assign it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, with the other assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. Loop Capital and Wells Fargo recently reiterated buy-equivalent ratings, and with 64.00% of shares held by institutional investors — including notable stakes from the three largest asset management companies, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — the stock is popular among Wall Street&#8217;s sell-side firms. Institutional holdings of Amazon have seen net increase with 2,907 position increases versus 2,419 position decreases. Wall Street expectations for where the stock goes in the next 52 weeks vary. While analysts overall anticipate healthy upside, the lowest price target indicates a decline in the share price. The consensus projection signals strong upside potential for the next 52 weeks, based on strong forward guidance for business segments like AWS and Prime Video&#8217;s ad sales, which saw enormous year-over-year increases as the platform now hosts the NFL&#8217;s Thursday Night Football programming. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $195.00 -12.67% Median $243.24 8.92% High $305.00 36.58% Amazon does face some headwinds and risks in addition to those mentioned above. Consumer spending has rebounded in the wake of Trump&#8217;s tariff threats and subsequent pauses, which could help GDP in Q2 after it contracted GDP in Q1, raising the risks of a possible recession in 2025. Over the past three months, however, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&amp;P 500 — into which Amazon falls — has performed the fourth best, posting a gain of 7.49%, trailing only technology, industrials and communication services. While the company dominates in the retail space and is a tech leader, competition in neither category is likely to go away anytime soon. All these things could have a huge impact on profitability. Despite some skeptics, the prospects for Amazon are optimistic overall, especially in the short term. Wall Street&#8217;s &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; consensus rating and the upside potential far outweigh the downside potential shares of AMZN face.

Consumer spending has rebounded in the wake of Trump&#8217;s tariff threats and subsequent pauses, which could help GDP in Q2 after it contracted GDP in Q1, raising the risks of a possible recession in 2025. Over the past three months, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&amp;P 500 — into which Amazon falls — has performed the fourth best, posting a gain of 15.80%, trailing only technology, industrials and communication services. While the company dominates in the retail space and is a tech leader, competition in neither category is likely to go away anytime soon. All these things could have a huge impact on profitability. Despite some skeptics, the prospects for Amazon are optimistic overall, especially in the short term. Wall Street&#8217;s &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; consensus rating and the upside potential far outweigh the downside potential shares of AMZN face.

Is Yours One Of Them?,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/these-are-the-six-jobs-ai-will-replace-is-20250707.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Two years ago, Goldman Sachs said that 300 million jobs would be lost or “degraded” by AI. People with AI skills may find that there are other job opportunities available in the economy. Other companies that have analyzed the effects put the number lower than that of Goldman Sachs. For example, MIT put the number at two million. However, this is only for manufacturing jobs. Key Points There Is A Wide Range Of Jobs AI Will Eliminate AI May Also Help Add New Jobs Take this quiz to see if you’re on track to retire. (sponsored) Companies have begun to eliminate jobs that AI can automate. Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) recently cut several thousand workers. Its management said AI does 30% of internal coding. These are the jobs that will be destroyed mainly by AI: People who work on assembly lines are at extreme risk. Manufacturing can replace many jobs in factory facilities with AI, which uses robotics. Those at particular risk have positions that involve repetitive work, and those at risk of “on-the-job” injuries. These jobs have also been described as “routine and predictable. Associates at legal firms are at risk. Many of the documents they write for court cases can be researched by AI. Additionally, the first draft of many briefs can also be generated by AI. Partners will need to review the work, but tasks that typically take days can be completed in hours. This is particularly true of appellate briefs, which are mostly based on gathering data from past briefs and older documents. Software coders are at risk. Much of the work they already do can be replaced by AI. This is basically what Microsoft has said. IBM (NYSE: IBM) and Meta (NASDAQ: META) have both stated that AI can perform lower-level coding, and in many cases, this has already begun. Anthropic CEO Dario Amodei said that AI will replace nearly half of entry-level white-collar jobs within the next five years. His company is one of the world&#8217;s leading AI software companies. The definition of a “white collar” job is one in which people work in an office and do management or administrative work. Human resource jobs face particular jeopardy because much of this work involves screening potential new employees. Ford CEO Jim Farley recently mentioned a similar level of white-collar job cuts. People who work at the checkout and those who work at counters are also at particularly significant risk. This includes millions of people who work at places like McDonald’s (NYSE: MCD), major banks and stores like Walmart. Some of this has already started. At many stores, people can check themselves out using bar code scanners and credit cards. People can make orders from the McDonald&#8217;s menu using an app. Many McDonald’s stores already have self-ordering kiosks, allowing customers to place their orders while in the store. A McKinsey report recently said AI could replace telemarketing jobs. Several companies already use tech-based chat to replace humans in answering simple questions online. AI software can be programmed to solicit customers. It can also be used to answer questions on the phone. This process has already begun, as many people call with basic customer service questions. AI will likely create new jobs in the economy. Jensen Huang, CEO of AI chip company Nvidia, recently said, “Since AI makes companies more productive, he believes it will end up creating more jobs than cutting them.” The post These Are The Six Jobs AI Will Replace.

According to the company, the Guilford store will open on Aug. 17. A new Target will also open on that date in Norwalk at 680 Connecticut Ave. Hours in Guilford will be 7 a.m. to 10 p.m., Monday through Friday, and 8 a.m. to 10 p.m. on Saturday and Sunday. Guilford’s Planning and Zoning Board approved Target's application to open in the 78,000 square-foot space formerly occupied by Walmart in September 2023. Walmart closed in May 2022. Construction on the new Target store began last summer. Target says the new store will also feature ""Apple at Target,"" a section that contains Apple products in a similar layout to a traditional Apple Store. There will also be a CVS Pharmacy, Starbucks Café, and Target Optical. Services will include drive up and order pickup. Overall, the Guilford store is expected to employ about 100 team members, Target notes on its website. The Guilford store represents Target's 23rd location in Connecticut, the company says, and its part of eight total that are opening this summer in California, Connecticut, Florida, New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania. Target says about 20 stores are on track to open across the country this year. Read also  First Selectman Matt Hoey said it's been ""exciting"" to see construction progress over the last year. He said the retailer's entry into Guilford is a welcomed sight. ""I'm thrilled a retailer of Target's reputation and quality has chosen Guilford to locate a store. We are, I would suggest, in dire need of that kind of store once Walmart pulled out,"" Hoey told Patch on Tuesday, noting that ""a good number"" of residents have had to travel to nearby towns to shop at large department stores. ""There will be less miles and less pollution because people will be able to stay local and buy local,"" he added.

You can use low-fee dividend-paying ETFs to help keep your costs low. Are you ahead, or behind on retirement? SmartAsset’s free tool can match you with a financial advisor in minutes to help you answer that today. Each advisor has been carefully vetted, and must act in your best interests. Don’t waste another minute; get started by clicking here.(Sponsor) If you&#8217;ve saved up $10,000 to invest in dividend stocks, congratulations. You&#8217;re ready to embark on a potentially profitable journey that will reward patience and prudence with time-tested wealth-building opportunities. Among the most important guidelines for a $10,000 dividend portfolio is to keep your costs down. Otherwise, your profits could turn into losses over the long run. The good news is that there are ways to save money, time, and effort with specific dividend portfolio building strategies. You&#8217;ll be amazed to discover how far you can stretch a $10,000 investment account if you proceed with prudence and due diligence. No Need to Pick Stocks There was a time, not too long ago, when high fees made picking individual stocks an expensive proposition. If you had a $10,000 investment account, the fees/commissions for buying and selling stocks could have noticeably reduced your portfolio&#8217;s value. Nowadays, however, the fees/commissions for buying and selling stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs) are typically very low or even nonexistent. This raises two significant points. First, you&#8217;ll want to choose a reputable low-cost broker if you have $10,000 to invest. The second point is that you may be tempted to buy hundreds of individual stocks because the high-fee barrier has been eliminated. Yet, it&#8217;s not necessarily a great idea to embark on a dividend stock picking journey. Bear in mind that stock picking involves time and research. Besides, you might not have the expertise or the confidence to successfully build your $10,000 portfolio with individual dividend stocks. A simple solution is to select a handful of dividend ETFs so you won&#8217;t have to do any stock picking. Just make sure that they&#8217;re low-fee ETFs that hold a variety of well-known dividend-paying stocks. High Quality Without High Costs If you have $10,000 to invest, you could go through the trouble of selecting 100 or more dividend stocks for a fully diversified portfolio. Or, you could just put $2,500 into four ETFs, or instead put $2,000 into five ETFs. To make it easier for you, I&#8217;ll point out a half-dozen diversified dividend-paying ETFs with annual operating fees below 1%. These are the Schwab U.S. Dividend Equity ETF (NYSEARCA:SCHD), the JPMorgan Equity Premium Income ETF (NYSEARCA:JEPI), the JPMorgan Nasdaq Equity Premium Income ETF (NASDAQ:JEPQ), the NEOS NASDAQ-100 High Income ETF (NASDAQ:QQQI), the NEOS S&amp;P 500 High Income ETF (BATS:SPYI), and the Amplify CWP Enhanced Dividend Income ETF (NYSEARCA:DIVO). You can go here to read my overview of QQQI, JEPQ, SCHD, DIVO, and SPYI. Then, you can go here to get my summary of JEPI. For now, here&#8217;s a bullet-point recap of this six-pack of diversified dividend-stock ETFs: SCHD: Focuses on the Dow Jones U.S. Dividend 100 Index; includes around 100 large-cap stocks; annual distribution (dividend) yield of 3.97%; annual operating fees (automatically deducted from the ETF&#8217;s share price) of 0.06% JEPI: Focuses on carefully selected S&amp;P 500 members; includes 122 stocks; annual yield of 8.25%; annual operating fees of 0.35% JEPQ: Focuses on the technology-heavy NASDAQ 100 index; includes 108 stocks; annual yield of 11.52%; annual operating fees of 0.35% QQQI: Focuses on the NASDAQ 100 stock index; includes approximately 100 stocks; annual yield of 14.65%; annual operating fees of 0.68% SPYI: Focuses on constituents of the S&amp;P 500; includes roughly 500 stocks; annual yield of 12.15%; annual operating fees of 0.68% DIVO: Focuses on large-cap dividend and earnings growers; includes 25 stocks; annual yield of 4.73%; annual operating fees of 0.56% These ETFs typically include established blue-chip stocks like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), Mastercard (NYSE:MA), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Coca-Cola (NYSE:KO), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), and McDonald’s (NYSE:MCD). Feel free to investigate the six low-fee ETFs I mentioned above along with other dividend-paying funds that meet your criteria. Strong Performance Doesn&#8217;t Have to Be Expensive So far, we&#8217;ve looked for ETFs featuring high-quality large-cap stock holdings, good diversification, and low annual operating fees. Plus, these funds usually cost less than $100 per share, so they should easily fit into a $10,000 portfolio. The final piece of the puzzle is to make sure that you&#8217;re picking ETFs that not only pay dividends, but also have share prices that increase over time. Otherwise, you could end up losing money overall even if you&#8217;re collecting dividend payments. To provide an example, you&#8217;ll notice that the SCHD ETF&#8217;s share price has increased dramatically over the years, and these gains don&#8217;t even include the dividend payments: Another example is the JEPI ETF, which has had its ups and downs but has still delivered substantial share-price gains (not including dividends): By making equal-sized contributions to four, five, or even six dividend ETFs, you could aim for both share-price growth and consistent dividends. With the right plan in place, you can maximize the profit potential of your $10,000 dividend portfolio while keeping your costs to an absolute minimum.The post How to Build a Super Low-Cost Dividend Portfolio for $10,000 appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/07/08/how-to-build-a-super-low-cost-dividend-portfolio-for-10000/

WMT,2025-07-14 10:05:22,2025 Grocery Store Closings Driven By These Factors,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/2025-grocery-store-closings-driven-by-these-factors-20250714.jpg,https://www.patch.com,"Your favorite grocery store could disappear or may have already closed due to a perfect storm of market conditions that range from rising food prices to labor and other operational challenges to evolving consumer preferences. There’s no single reason for the closures. “Grocery always has been a business with slim profit margins,” Barbara Kahn, a marketing professor at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School, told Patch in a telephone interview. Given the economic strains, “the ones on the margins won’t make it,” Kahn said. That doesn’t necessarily mean hometown independent grocers and smaller chains will be squeezed out, or that juggernauts like Walmart, Costco and Amazon will get bigger. Survival in the industry goes beyond profit statements, and stores with smaller footprints that listen to what customers want may be among the greatest winners, Kahn said. Here’s a quick look at some of the closings: Courts have blocked giants Kroger and Albertsons from going ahead with what would have been the biggest grocery store merger in U.S. history. Together, they own about 36 store brands. Kroger and Albertsons said the merger would allow them to compete with Walmart, Costco and Amazon, along with newer national players, discount grocers like Aldi and specialty stores like Trader Joe’s. The Federal Trade Commission and several states sued to block the merger, arguing it would harm consumers and workers by reducing competition, and the court agreed Now, both companies are re-examining their footprints. Kroger interim CEO Ron Sargent said in a June 20 conference call that the company would be closing 60 unprofitable stores nationwide over the next 18 months. Kroger didn’t disclose where the stores are located, but the United Food & Commercial Workers labor union and various news outlets have reported stores in Georgia, Illinois, Indiana, Kentucky, Maryland, North Carolina, Ohio, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, West Virginia and Wisconsin are targeted. Albertsons sued Kroger after the merger was blocked, alleging it had intentionally derailed the deal, stating in the lawsuit that it would be “identifying additional opportunities for value creation through the optimization of our substantial real estate footprint and other assets.” It didn’t say where the stores would be located, and pointed out the closures could take place over several years. Even behemoth Walmart with more than 4,600 U.S. locations plans to close some stores. The largest U.S. grocer said earlier this year it would close 11 underperforming stores in California, Colorado, Georgia, Maryland, Ohio and Wisconsin. Among other stores that are closing, according to a list compiled by Yahoo Finance, are: Creating value isn’t just about offering the lowest prices, but doing business in a substantially different way that makes customers want to shop there, Kahn said Mom-and-pop grocery stores and smaller chains have an outsized opportunity to create value by building on local tastes and traditions that will make customers want to shop with them, Kahn said. “By looking to see what the competition is doing and doing better than the competition, you can draw a buzz,” she said. “What you can’t do is keep doing what you’re doing, which is particularly true in groceries because the margins are so slim.” It’s a smart strategy for high-end stores, too. Some that are doing it well are H-E-B in Texas and Wegmans Food Markets in the Northeast, Kahn said. “They’re not the cheapest, but people are willing to pay for an upscale experience,” she said. One area where traditional grocery stores have taken a hit is in the sale of profit-generating “middle aisle” merchandise sold in large or bulk quantities, such as diapers, toilet paper and other household supplies. More consumers are ordering online and having the items delivered, and stores are also facing competition from drugstores, home improvement stores and other nontraditional competition, Kahn said. Labor costs remain a challenge for grocers, although some are affected to a greater degree than others, she said. Warehouse stores like Costco are able to shave labor costs by not breaking up bulk quantities. Other stores have used self-checkouts. “Retail theft is the flip side,” Kahn said. “That’s a constraint on profitability.” Technology exists to monitor customers’ grocery bags as they leave the store, but stores must weigh the costs of the technology versus the cost of theft, as well as the cost of hiring employees to staff checkouts. “Bottom line, grocery is a difficult business that takes discipline because it’s not just about marketing,” Kahn said. “Supply issues, e-commerce — although not a huge competitor, somewhat of a trend — and non-traditional stores, all making the business difficult.” In a tight economy, grocers are also reviewing whether their stores are in the right places. “In general, the U.S. was ‘over-stored’ for a while,” Kahn said. “There are some efficiencies in closing stores in areas that are over-served.” You may also like:",https://www.patch.com/us/across-america/2025-grocery-store-closings-driven-these-factors

WMT,2025-07-15 14:00:09,Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) Stock Price Prediction for 2025: Where Will It Be in 1 Year,https://images.financialmodelingprep.com/news/amazon-nasdaq-amzn-stock-price-prediction-for-2025-where-20250715.jpg,https://247wallst.com,"Shares of Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) remained mostly flat over the past five trading sessions, eking out a 0.01% gain and bringing the e-commerce and cloud storage solutions stock&#8217;s year-to-date gain to 1.42%. Over the past year, it is up 12.07%. On July 8, it was reported that Amazon founder Jeff Bezos sold nearly three million shares worth $665.8 million over two days in July as part of a plan announced earlier in 2025 that will see Bezos unload up to 25 million shares through May 2026. In June and July the stock saw a series of adjusted price targets from analysts. Truist raised its price target on AMZN to $250 from $226 while maintaining a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. Bank of America raised the its price target on AMZN to $248 from $230 while maintaining its &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating. Piper Sandler raised its price target on AMZN to $250 from $212 while maintaining an &#8220;Overweight&#8221; rating. Amazon announced in July that it has deployed its 1 millionth robot while also deploying its new AI foundation model to power its robotic fleet. Its first twelfth generation automated fulfillment center launched in late-2024 and the robots are primarily focused on delivery station efficiencies. The robotics cycle is &#8220;early,&#8221; according to Bank of America&#8217;s analyst, who expects Amazon to leverage robots to reduce labor dependency, increase order accuracy and improve warehouse efficiency, driving material cost savings. In its first-quarter earnings call, Amazon reported that Q1 revenue growth and an operating income increase. Amazon Ads generated $13.9 billion in revenue alone, representing a 19% year-over-year increase, while AWS grew by 17% year-over-year to an annualized revenue run rate of $117 billion. Still, the stock remains down nearly 15% from its all-time high on Feb. 4, with its one-year gain now standing at 15.87%. Still, while there can be little doubt about its current financial health, investors and potential investors may be right to wonder whether growth can continue at Amazon&#8217;s historic pace, and whether the stock is safe as a long-term holding. Let&#8217;s take a look at where the share price could be headed. 24/7 Wall St. Key Points: Amazon is facing substantial headwinds this year, but the stock remains fundamentally sound with a &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. AWS, AI and ad sales continue to be major drivers for the Magnificent Seven stock. If you’re looking for a megatrend with massive potential, make sure to grab a complimentary copy of our “The Next NVIDIA” report. This report breaks down AI stocks with 10x potential and will give you a huge leg up on profiting from this massive sea change. Why Invest in Amazon? In the past 20 years, Amazon&#8217;s stock is up more than 9,188%. The company has been called one of the most influential economic and cultural forces in the world, and its brand is one of the world&#8217;s most valuable. Though the stock tumbled as the COVID-19 pandemic waned and lockdowns ended (along with the broader markets), it has more than recovered. Shares of this Magnificent Seven member hit an all-time high on Feb. 4, 2025, but with the Nasdaq briefly entering bear market territory in March, it had been downhill for Amazon in 2025. There have been signs of hope recently, with AMZN rebounding along with the broad market. It is hard to imagine that the company or its share price will collapse any time soon, but analysts and investors may see the stock as overbought. Let&#8217;s see what Wall Street expects. Amazon as a Company The company engages in the retail sale of consumer products, advertising, and subscriptions service through online and physical stores internationally. It also manufactures and sells electronic devices and develops and produces media content. Amazon Web Services (AWS) provides compute, storage, database, analytics, machine learning, and other services. And Amazon Prime is the company&#8217;s membership program. Amazon is based in Seattle. It was founded in 1994 by Jeff Bezos, the former chief executive officer and now executive board chair. Amazon went public in May 1997. Its retail competitors include Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. (NYSE:BABA), Kroger Co. (NYSE:KR) and Walmart Inc. (NYSE:WMT). It also competes with the likes of Netflix Inc. (NASDAQ:NFLX) and Microsoft Corp. (NASDAQ:MSFT). The company continues its push into artificial intelligence with an update of its Alexa feature to Alexa+. AWS investments in cloud computing and AI also continue, with the former being the world&#8217;s largest cloud services provider and the latter nearing its debut of its &#8220;Nova&#8221; chatbot, which will compete in price with ChatGPT. Additionally, Amazon has been expanding its same-day delivery services, and its entertainment division has secured the James Bond franchise with the acquisition of MGM Studios. Headwinds include ongoing labor issues. The most recent quarterly results showed strong performance, with AWS as a major growth driver. Amazon as a Stock Since hitting its all-time high on Feb. 4, the stock has lost 6.77%. Note that Wall Street analysts&#8217; median price target of $250.95 is above Amazon&#8217;s all-time high share price seen earlier this year. Of the 45 analysts covering AMZN, all but one assign it a &#8220;Buy&#8221; rating, with the other assigning it a &#8220;Hold&#8221; rating. Overall, the stock receives a consensus &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; rating. Loop Capital and Wells Fargo recently reiterated buy-equivalent ratings, and with 65.28% of shares held by institutional investors — including notable stakes from the three largest asset management companies, Vanguard, BlackRock and State Street — the stock is popular among Wall Street&#8217;s sell-side firms. Institutional holdings of Amazon have seen net increase with 2,899 position increases versus 2,423 position decreases. Wall Street expectations for where the stock goes in the next 52 weeks vary. While analysts overall anticipate healthy upside, the lowest price target indicates a decline in the share price. The consensus projection signals strong upside potential for the next 52 weeks, based on strong forward guidance for business segments like AWS and Prime Video&#8217;s ad sales, which saw enormous year-over-year increases as the platform now hosts the NFL&#8217;s Thursday Night Football programming. Estimate Price Target %Change From Current Price Low $195.00 -13.09% Median $250.95 11.83% High $305.00 35.92% Amazon does face some headwinds and risks in addition to those mentioned above. Consumer spending has rebounded in the wake of Trump&#8217;s tariff threats and subsequent pauses, which could help GDP in Q2 after it contracted GDP in Q1, raising the risks of a possible recession in 2025. Over the past three months, the consumer discretionary sector of the S&amp;P 500 — into which Amazon falls — has performed the fourth best, posting a gain of 16.71%, trailing only technology, industrials and communication services. While the company dominates in the retail space and is a tech leader, competition in neither category is likely to go away anytime soon. All these things could have a huge impact on profitability. Despite some skeptics, the prospects for Amazon are optimistic overall, especially in the short term. Wall Street&#8217;s &#8220;Strong Buy&#8221; consensus rating and the upside potential far outweigh the downside potential shares of AMZN face.

Meanwhile, the RSPA ETF is widely diversified but also pays big dividends. It’s hard to believe, but today there are credit cards offering up to 6% cash back, $200 statement credits, $0 annual fees, travel rewards, and more. See for yourself, I couldn’t believe it at first. Frankly, with rewards this good we don’t expect them to be available forever. But if you sign up today you can secure some of the best rewards we’ve ever seen. Click here to get started. If you&#8217;ve managed to save up $500,000 to invest in stocks and exchange traded funds (ETFs), pat yourself on the back. You&#8217;re in a great position to earn tens of thousands of dollars in worry-free income each and every year. Two passive income powerhouses are particularly well-suited for investors seeking relatively safe dividends/distributions. With these two high-yield funds, you could generate $40,000 per year from a half-a-million-dollar account. So, let&#8217;s look at a pair of ETFs that could help you grow your fortune while you sleep soundly at night. QDVO: Tech Exposure, Decent Diversification It might sound risky to take $500,000 and equally divide it among just two funds. However, this plan can make sense if the two funds provide good diversification across well-known stocks. The first ETF that fits this description is the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF (NYSEARCA:QDVO). This ETF generates income from dividends and premium payments from writing/selling call options. Since the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF includes 42 stocks in its holdings, you&#8217;ll achieve diversification with just this one fund. Plus, you&#8217;ll get portfolio exposure to highly established technology giants like Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT), NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA), Amazon (NASDAQ:AMZN), and Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL). While the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF emphasizes large-cap technology stocks, it also includes non-tech names such as Visa (NYSE:V), Home Depot (NYSE:HD), Costco Wholesale (NASDAQ:COST), and RTX/Raytheon Technologies (NYSE:RTX). Consequently, your $500,000 portfolio won&#8217;t be too tech-heavy with the QDVO ETF. An added bonus of the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF is that it pays out its dividends/distributions on a monthly basis. Hence, there&#8217;s no need to wait three full months to start seeing the cash show up in your account. Getting down to the nitty-gritty, the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF offers an annual distribution rate of 9.87%, but also deducts 0.55% worth of operating expenses. This means that QDVO&#8217;s expected annualized net yield for investors would be 9.87% &#8211; 0.55%, or 9.32%. RSPA: High Yield, Hundreds of Famous Names Even though the the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF has plenty of benefits, you don&#8217;t have to pour an entire $500,000 account into one fund. Instead, you could allocate $250,000 toward QDVO and the remaining $250,000 into the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF (NYSEARCA:RSPA). Generally based on the S&amp;P 500 index, the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF has 524 stocks in its holdings. Moreover, it&#8217;s not too heavily allocated toward technology or any other sector, as the RSPA ETF places roughly equal weighting on each stock. Within the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF you&#8217;ll find technology luminaries like Microsoft, Apple, and Micron Technology (NASDAQ:MU). Yet, you&#8217;ll also discover non-technology-focused firms such as PepsiCo (NASDAQ:PEP), Walmart (NYSE:WMT), Chevron (NYSE:CVX), and Bank of America (NYSE:BAC). Hence, you can massively diversify your portfolio with the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF and sleep all night long worry-free. Furthermore, there&#8217;s an added benefit with this fund because, like QDVO, RSPA pays out its distributions every month. The annual distribution rate for the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF is 9.13%, which is quite impressive. When we subtract the operating fees of 0.29% per year, the RSPA ETF should provide an expected net annual yield of 9.13% &#8211; 0.29%, or 8.84%. Getting $40,000 Each Year From Two ETFs Now, let&#8217;s do the math with these two terrific funds. For extra-wide diversification, you could put $250,000 into the Amplify CWP Growth &amp; Income ETF and another $250,000 into the Invesco S&amp;P 500 Equal Weight Income Advantage ETF. Then, your average expected net annual yield would be (9.32% + 8.84%) / 2, or 9.08%. Actually, your yield could be even higher if you reinvest the cash distributions every month, but let&#8217;s keep it simple and assume a 9.08% yield for now. After one year, assuming the two funds don&#8217;t reduce their distribution rates, you could expect to receive cash distributions totaling $500,000 x 9.08%, or $45,400. This allows some room for error, as it easily beats your goal of earning $40,000 in dividends/distributions. Of course, you should monitor the share prices of the two ETFs and not only the distribution rates. After all, you&#8217;ll want to see some share-price appreciation to further build your $500,000 nest egg. There&#8217;s no need to lose sleep over this issue, though, since the QDVO and RSPA ETFs should gain value over the long run. These two funds hold a variety of blue-chip stocks so you can rest easy while collecting $40,000 in cash every 12 months.The post How to Turn $500K into $40,000 in Annual Passive Income Without Losing Sleep appeared first on 24/7 Wall St..",https://247wallst.com/investing/2025/07/15/how-to-turn-500k-into-40000-in-annual-passive-income-without-losing-sleep/

Documents filed with the city show the fast-food restaurant is applying to open a 1357 Boston Post Road store. The restaurant at the Milford Crossing plaza would include a two-lane drive-thru where employees would be outside taking orders and payment during peak times. The location is proposed in the city's Shopping Center Design District, which doesn't specifically allow or prohibit drive-thru service, so a special exception will be required for the project to move forward. The proposed restaurant would be 5,097 square feet. The drive-thru would need a ""10-car waiting position"" for each lane, according to documents filed with the city. A project representative said at a Planning and Zoning Board meeting Tuesday night that the dual-lane drive-thru design is in line with the ""newest improvements"" Chick-fil-A has made. The restaurant would include 90 seats inside and 16 more seats on an outdoor patio. At the Planning and Zoning Board meeting, board members expressed concerns about the plan's impact on parking, traffic flow, and pedestrian safety at the site. The parking lot would require 68 parking spaces for the restaurant, with 125 spaces reserved for the existing Barnes & Noble building. The restaurant is planned to be constructed in the existing parking lot, reducing the number of overall spaces at the site. However, the total number of spaces at the site would still be 1,758, which is within zoning regulations. A project representative at the Planning and Zoning meeting said that parking to the south of the restaurant will be used for employees. There will be a raised crosswalk with a signal light that goes from the parking area to the Chick-fil-A. City Planner David Sulkis noted that drive-thru restaurants approved by the board have typically included a bypass lane as well, calling it a ""good practice"" and noting that the proposed Chick-fil-A has no such lane. A project representative responded that the dual-lane system allows Chick-fil-A to dedicate one lane as a bypass during off-peak hours. Then during peak hours, employees would be able to direct traffic as needed. The project will be on the board's agenda at its next meeting, which is scheduled for Aug. 5. Other tenants at Milford Crossing include Walmart, Marshalls, Home Goods, Staples, and Petco. Chick-fil-A currently has 16 Connecticut locations, with those nearby in Shelton and West Haven. The chain is known for its fried chicken sandwiches and waffle fries. The West Haven store is drive-thru only and opened last year.

In May, BV1 Logistics Acquisitions LLC submitted a proposal on behalf of Brookfield to the city to demolish 10 fuel tanks located at 3790 Pickett Road and replace them with two warehouse buildings. ""There's really not been sites like this in the City of Fairfax,"" said Bob Grant of law firm Walsh Carlucci, who spoke for BV1 Logistics Acquisitions during Wednesday's public hearing. ""It's zoned in the IH Industrial Heavy District. This is one of the few pockets of industrial uses in the city."" Since the warehouses are an approved use in an IH District, Brookfield plans to construct the two buildings by-right and doesn't need approval from the City Council to move forward. However, the applicant still needs to obtain zoning approvals and permits prior to construction. ""Brookfield is hoping to attract, as it usually does, Fortune 500 companies, like Target, like Walmart, and Pepsi that occupy the other buildings throughout their portfolio, to this area,"" Grant said. Originally built in the 1960s, the entire Tank Farm property is approximately 18.93 acres in size and located at the intersection of Colonial Avenue and Pickett Road. Brookfield plans to build the two structures on the northeast corner of the property. The warehouses are planned to be 311,580 square feet in size and oriented around a central internal truck court, according to the staff report. To the north, a wooded buffer separates the site from the adjacent EYA Sutton Heights townhome development. The properties to the east, south and west of BVI Logistics' project are also zoned industrial. Now that the BAR approved the design of the warehouses, the applicant's next step is to submit a site plan for review, which Grant said would happen in the next few weeks. He estimated the all the zoning approvals and permits could be obtained within a year and demolition of the 10 tanks would begin soon after that.
